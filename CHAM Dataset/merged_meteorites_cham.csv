Holbrook Happenings.
From the Argus.
Mrs. E. H. Bargeman left for
Winslow Tuesday morning. She
will make her future home
there. Mr. and Mrs. Barge
man's many Holbrook friends,
while regretting their depar
ture. wish them success in their
new home.
Some unknown party gained
entrance to C. F. Perkins’ resi
dence Monday or Tuesday and
changed clothes, he also took a
new coat and a silver watch to
boot. Mr. Perkins noticed the
change Wednesday and notified
the officers. As yet the thief
has not been apprehended.
Mr. and Mrs. Houck returned
home Sunday night from Yuma
where Mr. Houck delivered five
prisoners into the custody ot
the prison officials. Chet in
formed us that Smith, the rob
ber who was captured at Can
yon Diablo, was well known in
Yuma, where he is known as
Win. Evans and was out on
parole at the time he held up
the Wigwam Saloon. He was
sentenced from Tombstone in
181*7 to 10 years in Yuma and
was paroled in 1903. Oldtimers
may remember Smith as a run
ning mate of Charley Wagner,
known as “Six-shooter Bill.
A strange thing is that his part
ner in the Tombstone robbery
was killed while resisting ar
rest. The robber who was kill
ed at Canyon Diablo was parol
led at the same time Smith
was; he was known in the pri
son as Geo. Wholschlegel.
Charles Mainz, a special po
liceman employed by the Santa
Fe Railway at Isleta. was ar
rested last week charged with
assaulting George Ellis, with
intent to Kill. The warrant
making the charge was issued
on complaint of Ellis. Ellis
was shot a few days ago by the
policeman, while resisting ar
rest. He is now in the Santa
Fe hospital at Albuquerque,
slowly recovering from the bul- I
let wound.
A meteorite found in the Can- ]
yon Diablo, Ariz., on the Santa
Fe line, and exhibited in the
American Museum of Natural
History, New York, contains a
small diamond, and is the onlyj
known occurrence of a diamond
in a meteorite.—The Earth.

fHINK FAMOUS SWIND
LER WANTED TO BUY
BANK AT FLAGSTAFF
Charles W. French, who is mention
ed n the Associated Press dispatches
as one of the heads of the million dol
lar swindle and who has been arrest
. cd alonjr with John W. Worthington,
a Chicago banker, for organizing the
most gigantic swindle ever perpetra
ted in the country is supposed to bo
one C. W. French who was operating
in this state about ten years ago.
C. W. French came here as a pro
moter of various schemes all of which
were suspicious on the face of them.
Ho was negotiating also for the pur
chase of a bank at Flagstaff. Stories
of his operations reached the authori
ties of Salt Lake, who sent to James
G. Simpson, then of the rcportorial
staff of The Republican, a list of ques
tions amounting to a questionnaire
concerning the activities of Mr.
French.
It appeared that throughout his op
erations here he was skating on ex
ceedingly thin ice, but it held his
weight But the Utah authorities be
lieved thoy had the goods on him and
sought his extradition. They sent an
aeent here to take him back. A hear
ing on the application for a warrant
of extradition in which French was
represented by Robert S. .Fisher, took
place before Governor Hunt, who fin
ally refused to issue the warrant
The liveliest interest was taken all
over the country in the proceedings.
Papers in Chicago, New York, Pitts
burg and other eastern cities kept the
wires hot with their demands for news
about French.
It appeared that he also was wanted
at Akron, Ohio, where, by the way,
according to the dispatches of yester
day, one of thee associates of French
was taken into custody.

GIRAND GRANTED PER
MIT FOR POWER SITE
AT BOULDER CANYON
On Tuesday of last week the Feder
al Power commission at Washington,
D. C, granted a preliminary permit
to James B. Girand, of Phoenix, for
the development of 150,000 horse
pow er of hydro-electric power.
The sito for development of this
huge amount of power is ,on the Colo
rado river, near the mouth of Diamond
creek in Mohave county, and it is pro
posed to generate sufficient power to
electrify the inter-mountain section
of the Santa Fe .railway, furnish pow
er and lights for all the towns in
northern and central Arizona and fur
nish the necessary power for all in
dustries in this section.
Until about three years aero Mr.
Girand was city engineer for Phoenix,
which position he gave up that he
might work out the details of this
project, which he has been workinsr
on for the last decade.
There are now eight different com
panies working for the control of this
huge power project Its development
will mean the spending of many mill
ions oi uouars.
DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS WILL
PICTURE ""VIRGINIAN""
NEAR HOLBROOK
Douglas Fairbanks will film another
movie close to Holbrook, according to
the statement made to the editor of
the Holbrook Tribune, Wednesday, by
Doran H. Cox, assistant director of
the Douglas Fairbanks movie com
pany. Mr. Cox states that it is the
intention to film ""The Virginian,"" the
author being that noted writer, Owen
Wistcr. Mr. Cox states that parts of
the play will be reproduced from diff
erent sections of the country. That
portion of the story which had as its
location at Mexlicinc Boy, Wyoming,
is to re-enacted at Holbrook. Mr. Cox
toured many sections of the west in
search of a placo having a similar
setting to Medicine Bow. It was his
good fortune this week to find exact
ly what ho wanted about five miles
south of Holbrook, on the line of the
Apache railway. He states that the
place selected has the exact appear
ance of Medicine Bow low, rolling
hills, bare of trees, and in all respects
almost a duplicate of the town in
Wyoming made famous by Owen Wis
tcr in ""The Virginian.""

TWO VALLEY WOMEN
BADLY BURNED AT
STONEMAN LAKE
Mrs. A. N. Crawford of Clarkdalo
is lying today at the United Verde
hospital suffering from severe burns
on face and arms, and Mrs. H. P.
Hughes of Clarkdale is at her home,
badly burned about the arms.
The ladies and their husbands
were spending a short vacation at
Stoneman Lake and when they went
to prepare dinner they ""noticed that
the gasoline stove installed in the
cabin was leaking, the discovery being
made just after they had started the
fire. Mrs. Hughes called to her hus
band to come and ston the leak, but
before ho could ujnter the cabin, the
stove exploded and scattered the blaz
ing gasoline over both women. The
force of the explosion blew the door
of the cottage shut and it was several
minutes before Hughes could render
effective aid.
The men of the nartv realized thnt
the women were in need of immediate
medical aid and hastily nrenared for
the long automobile journey home.
With the innate perversity that some
times characterizes inanimate things,
the Hughes car refused to act proper
ly and a Ford was hastily borrowed
from a neighboring rancher. The long
journey ended about 2 o'clock this
morning just below Camp Veide when
the United"" Verde ambulance met the
party and made a quick trip with the
suffering women to the hospital.
As stated, Mrs. Hughes' burns,
while extremely painful, were not ser
ious and she was able to return to her
home. Mrs. Crawford's condition is
not considered at all dangerous, but
she will ,be compelled to remain at the
hospital for several days. Mr. Hugh
es is in the railroad department of
the United Verde and Mr. Crawford
is assistant assayer of the company.

BIG WIND AT NEEDLES
DOES MUCH DAMAGE
At 5:15 last Sunday afternoon
Ncedjes was visited by one of the
worst wind storms in its history. A
rain cloud came up from the south ac
companied by a strong wind and an
other came off the mountains to the
west. The latter was also accompan
ied by wind but of milder velocity.
The clouds and wind currents seem to
have met southeast of town and the
one from the south being considerably
stronger caused a whirlwind of trrcat
velocity to sweep through the city, do
ing uamage to an Kinas oi property,
but with few exceptions, the damage
was not 'of a serious nature. The
storm was accompanied by rain and
sharp and frequent flashes of light
ning and it certainly had the ear
marks of a fair-sized hurricane, the
velocity of the wind being probably
fifty or sixty miles an hour. Had it
been 110 miles an hour, as stated in
a report to county scat papers, there
would be"" no Needles today, and the
loss of life would have been great. As
it is no one was even hurt, which
seems a miracle in itself.
The loss of property damaged by the
wind will run into hundreds of dollars
but the greatest loss is to the many
trees uprooted in the various parks
and throughout the entire city, which
are a total loss and will take several
years to replace. Needles Nugget.
o
REMARKABLE METEORITE
FOUND NEAR NAVAJO
Now on exhibition at Navajo is a
remarkable meteorite, lately found
about 15 miles from that point by
Robert Thomas and Carl Hill. It
weighs about 4,000 pounds and is 33
inches in extreme diameter. Its ma
terial is a magnetic metal that is
heavier than iron and yet so malleable
that it may be hammered without
breaking to the ""thinness of paper.
Across the top is a deep crack, be
lieved to have been made in a remote
age when the celestial visitor dropped
into water and was suddenly cooled.
Analyses made show a large per
centage, but little platinum, in the
latter uoint differing from the me
teoric fragments gathered around the
great crater near Canyon Diablo, west
of Holbrook and Navajo. It is notable
also that smoothed faces of the Nav
ajo meteorite fail to show the Wid
mnnstattcn figures usually found and
quite prominent in all the Canyon Di
ablo fragments. These figures are
developed by the use of acid and,
fancifully, have been imagined writ
ings by means of which the people of
other spheres have attempted to com
municate with the inhabitants of the
earth.

THIS POOR BOOTLEGGER
SURE HAD FIERCE LUCK
All is not velvet for the bootlegger.
One was recently getting on a San
Diego train bound for Los Angeles
with a grip full of genuine goods
from across the line. As he put his
foot on the first step the handle of
his precious grip gave away and the
grip fell to the sidewalk. He left
hurriedly for parts unknown with the
piece of the strap handle while the
passengers soon congregated around
the spot and took a good whiff of the
banned stuff. As the train pulled out
the station agent kicked the grip in
side the station. You may guess the
rest of the story. Needles Nugget.

NATION CUTS DOWN AMOUNT
SPENT ON CANDY, AUTOS.
It cost the nation $54,000,000 less
to fill its sweet tooth during the past
fiscal year than in the previous year,
according to preliminary annual sta
tistics of the internal revenue bureau,
$408,729,560 being spent for candy
compared with $462,840,660 in 1920.
It cost more, however, to keep the
country's jaws in motion, the chewing
gum bill for 1921 amounting to $44,
405,900 as against $37,498,100 in 1920.
Facial decorations were les3 costly,

ics and perfumes amounting to $145,
019,100, as compared with $160,693,
025 in 1921.
The country's spending also fell off
considerably in other lines, the total
outlay on automobiles being, $1,675,
763,800 as against $2,008,665,080 in
1920. and on jewelry to $486,076,100

I RAILROAD DIVIDENDS.
B L. J. Bryant, cashier of tho Dank of
H Arlington, Ky., writes to tho Manufac-
H Hirers' Ilecord as follows: ""How
H many railroad corporations pay In ex-
H cess of G per cent dividend on tho in-
H vestment? Great sums are earned an-
H nually, It is true, often Into tho mil-
H lions of dollars, but when fixed and

H earnings aro often small, and tho
H country at largo Is tho benellclary of

H employes, etc., and It flows right back
H Into tho channels of trnde.
H ""Tho relations of tho railroads and
H tho farmer, manufacturer and mer
M chant are so closely interwoven that
H tho success of ono depends largely
m upon tho success of tho other; thoy
H havo gono hand In hand for decades in

M sources of tho country. The better
H Bervico the railroad can maintain for
H tho handling of tho various comniodl

H of tho farmer and manufacturer;

B to that extent tho business cammu

M Do Sk' s Rain Diamonds?
M Do the heavens rain diamonds? BI
M zarre as miy appear Meydenbauer's
M theory that the diamond is of cosmic
M origin and has fallen as a meteorite at
M later periods of the earth's formation,
B there are evidences thereof, tho most
m striking confirmation coming from
M Arizona. Hero on a broad plain, over
M an area of about Ave miles In dlame-
M tcr, had been scattered ono or two
M thousand masses of metallic iron, the
M fragments varying In weight from half
M a ton to a fraction of nn ounce. There
M was little doubt these masses formed
M part of a meteoric shower, although
M no record existed as to when the fall
M took place. Curiously enough, near
M the center whero most of tho meteor-
M ltes had been found, was a crater with
M raised edges three-quarters of a mile
M in diameter and about COO feet deep,
M bearing exactly the appearance which
M would be produced had a mighty mnss
m of Iron struck the ground and buried
m Itself deep under tho surface. An an-
m clent meteorologist In cutting a sec-
M tlon of this meteorite found the tools
M were Injured by something vastly
M harder than metallic Iron, and soon
announced that he had found black
M and transparent diamonds. Since this
M revelation diamond hunting In meteor-
M ltes has occupied chemists all over tho
M world, some of whom, like Sir William
m Brookes, havo made a successful find.
M So look nut for meteors. They may

""A stranger once visited a mer
chant of Marseilles with a letter of in
troduction from Alexander Dumas. It
was a glowing letter. Tho merchant
welcomed the stranger warmly, and
entertained him with great hospital
ity for three weoks.
""Then, In tho night, tho guest dis
appeared, taking with him his host's
best horse and a quantity of silver
plute.
""The merchant, on his next visit to
Paris sought out Dumas.
'""A pretty guest you sent me,' he
said bitterly. 'The fellow decamped
with my best horse and plate, worth
5,000 francs.'
""'What!' cried Dumas, horror
stricken. 'Did ho steal from you,
too?' ""

Two Klndr of Cheese In Essex.
Charles Samuel Story of Essox,
Mass., who is noted for witty sayings,
was In a well known grocer's store In
that town when a stranger came in.
Tho grocer was extremely slow when
waiting on a customer.
Tho stranger called for a pound of
cheese, and the grocer leaned ovor
tho counter in his slow way and
asked ""Will you havo tho now or
old?""
Story, who stood beside tho cus
tomer, saw that the stranger hesitated
so ho spoke In a hurried whisper, say
ing: ""Take the new; it will bo old
by the time you get It.""
The stranger called for tho new.

ADVICE FROM THE PROFESSOR.!
Perhaps Not Strictly In Order, but
Still Good Sense.
A young Southern lawyer sat In the
Supremo court in which Justice Hen
ry M. Glldersleevo was trying a case.
""This is the first t'mo I have ever
seen the Justice,"" be said, ""but if he's
as broad-minded as other members of
his family there'll bo no narrow ap
plication of the law in this case. A
relative of his, Prof. Glldersleove, was
my professor in tho University of Vir
ginia. I was in the same class of
which young Bradley Johnson, son of
the famous Confederate General of
that name, who died last fall, was a
member. One day several of us had
been out on a carouse and had failed
to appear for recitations. It was our
duty to report to Prof. Glldersleeve
and make our excuses. I think it was
I that was deputed to present the ex
cuse. I hadn't said much when the
professor broke in with a sternness
which made us wish wo couldn't tell
the difference between French wine
and corn whisky.
""'Young gentlemen,' he said, 'yon
must realize you havo entered upon
tho stern realities of life'
""Wo all bowed humbly, wondering
whether expulsion was to bo our fate.
'""Young gentlemen,' he added,
'never tnke It with water. I never
do. Good day, gentlemen.'"" New
York Times.
The Things We Eat.
Gregory E. Owens, a food Inspector
of Manchester, had an odd experience
the other day.
He was examining tho meat In a
small butcher shop on a back street.
Tho greater part of the meat was
fairly good, but there was one lot of
pork nnd beef that was rather ques
tionable. Tho butcher stood outsldo with a
customer. Tho Inspector called him
in.
""Look here,"" ho said, ""what Is your
opinion of this meat hero?""
Tho butcher looked It over.
""I had forgotten all about that,"" ho
said. ""It Is pretty old stock.""
""Well, what Is your opinion of It?""
""My opinion,"" said the butcher
slowly, ""Is that It Is unfit for human
food; but It might do for sausage.""

happened. They may be hunter's

On the way to camp, Don Santiago

a second. My friend fired at coyote

struck the ground just in front, and
so alarmed Mr. Coyote, that he
dropt the jack and bolted into -the
brush by the road. Coyote No. 2
promptly snapped up the rabbit
and bolted into the brush on the
opposite side.
That same evening, Don San

He got close to a tree whereon a
fine gobbler was perched. He notic
ed that the fowl was uneasy, cran

thought nothing of it, and fired.
The shot told and the bird came
tumbling down and fell right into
the mouth f a hungry coyote, both
disappearing together into the
brush. My triimd swears it was the
same coyote that he shot at in the
morning. ;

ALLAN JAYNES
EDITOR TUCSON
CITIZEN IS DEAD
-Allan B. Jaynes, national republi
can committeeman for Arizona, and
editor and managing director of the
Tucson Citizen, died Sunday night at
his home at Tucson after an illness
of a litle more than two weeks. When
Mr. Jaynes was first stricken it was
Vbelieved that he was suffering from
N appendicitis, and an investigation .dis
closed that that diagnosis was correct,
but an abscess was discovered that
first demanded treatment. That was
cleared, but Mr. Jaynes by that time
had become so weakened by disease
and by-his labors during the campaign
that he succumbed, although on Sat
urday night hope was held out for hi.i
recovery. Mr. Jaynes' last visit to
, Phoenix on official business connected
,with the campaign was less than two
( weeks ago. He, was then quite ill, but
the serious nature of his malady was
not then suspected.
Mr. Jaynes was born-in Columbus,
Ohio, where he resided until he came
s to Arizona, nearly 20 years ago. He
was 41 years old. He was graduated
from the Ohio State university, where
he was a classmate of an elder brpth-
, er of Dean William Scarlett, andliv-

with, George H. Smalley he was en-

paper. Soon thereafter he was ap-
pointed clerk of the district, the ap-!
R.1 Davis, then associate justice of the
territorial supreme court and presid
ing judge of that district Judge Da

About 1900 Mr. Jaynes became as

Returning from the national con

in this state, but in the general work
of the national committee. His illness
was traced to the weakening effect of
his labors during the last three
months.

FOUR LOOPDELEGATES
AT DENVER CONVENTION
The Park-to-Park Highway asso
ciation convention, about which con
siderable was said in last week's Sun,
and about which there arc more par
ticulars elsewhere in this issue, con
vened yesterday, at Denver, to last
the rest of this week. Coconino
county has three t delegates present:
Chairman ""Fred Garing, of the board
of supervisors; Charlie Woolfolk,
member, and Wm. C. Rittenhouse,
who becomes a four-year, member of
the board on January 1. The business
interests of Flagstaff and town
of Flagstaff are represented by .
Father C. Vabre. All four of these
gentlemen left for Denver Tuesday
night.
That there are four men represent-'with
ing us at the convention, .and four
cood men. is something that we
should feei elated over. For in their
presence we feel that we are being
ably represented. Apart from that,
sending"" four men to this important
gathering is doing our. part toward
making it representative and in swell
ing the, attendance to an impressive
total. ,
Mr. Woolfolk made a suggestion
before leaving for Denver that is well,
yrthy of adoption by every county
and town along the line of the pro
posed highway. It is that each coun
ty and incorporated town contribute
toward the funds needed to carry on
the' propaganda and organization
work being done and that still re
mains to be done by -the National.
Park-to-Park Highway association,
rather than to leave the financing, as
has been the case too often in the
past, to individuals.
This project, Mr. Woolfolk feels, is
one that can well be adopted by the
counties and cities as a co-operative
enterprise. This would not only make
such funds as the association needs
immediately available, with no col-

These congratulations are justified.
The committee did its work well.
There was .no mud-slinging. Every
man did the part- assigned to him,
promptly and thoroughly.- Harmony
prevailed among the members every

lection expense, but should the project
thus become a matter of public rather
than private enterprise it would more
certainly be assured of the enthusias
tic backing of every voter and get be
hind it in congress the active support
of our senators and representatives.
In speaking of funds in this con-
nection, it should be noted that they
are needed not for building the nearly
6,000 miles of park-to-park hard-surfaced
boulevard, which it is planned
to build with federal money secured
by congressional appropriation, but to
sustain the work or the association
that is behind the park-topark high
way project. This association still
has a vast amount of work to do, and
its plans are so closely linked Up
the future development of this
part of the United States that it
j would be folly to permit its work to be
in uny way impeiieu Dy iacK oi mon
ey. Think for a moment what this proj
ect means to Flagstaff. If that high
way is built, the automobile traffic
through here from the western states
alone will be more than double what
it is now. Hundreds of people in
every town and city on or near the
route would plan at the very first op
portunity to run out the family car,
load in the kids, and set off on the
great trip around the loop, because it
would be the most wonderful automo
bile trip in the world free from the
mud. tno rocky roads, the impossible
grades, the dangerous fords and the
other drawbacks that now make, the
trip impossible except at the expense
of much money, time and patience.
When the road is built and it
seems pretty certain that it will be
a Flagstaff family, traveling in a Ford
car, will be able to make the nearly
6,000 mile loop with hardly a change
of tire, with never a pull-out by a
team, without even having to stop to
ask which is the right road.

Metsker and Carter Joy remembered
about that time that the basement of
the Harper store on North San Fran

wen around behind the store to close
it. They saw a man walking away
from the rear. From his1 apparent

there was someone else in the store.
Metsker,, went into the basement to

Its publication prior to election was
not needed to secure votes for Gov

people paid no heed to the ridiculous
charges being made against him in
connection with the administration of
state prison affairs., Its publication
now is merely as a matter of news:
""My attention just called to article

Dave P. Roberts. Sentence of this
man was commuted from life to 15
years by Governor Hunt in 1918. No
request for his extradition has ever

other source. Letters in this office
prove that Roberts is willing to return
at any time .upon my request or that

to 'beat it,' as his case was not to be

C. A. Black, who went to Los An

John Chisholm, who went to Los An

her son, Jack Chisholm, on Wednes
day, that the surgeons were undecided
whether to operate.
This is regarded here as meaning
that Mr. Black's condition . has im

ADDITIONAL PAVING TO
BE DONE NEXT SPRING
The Warren Bros. Construction
company have closed' down Work on
the blthulithic paving of the National
Old Trails through the city. Work
will be resumed as early in the spring
as the weather permits.
It is probable that as soon as they
have completed the present contract
they will have a lot more paving to
do here. One stretch of two blocks
has already been decided upon
Agassiz street from Railroad avenue
to Birch avenue, Babbitt Bros., who
own much of the property along that
stretch, having ordered the paving
done. This will be a bir imnrove-

THE WOOL .MARKET
Wool men are feeling better, though
not because of increased business or
better prices. The result of the elee""
tion is, however, thought to mean a
tariff on wool. This, howeVer, may
cut off importers and brokers from
profits on which they were depending
to recoup themselves for their en
forced idleness during the war. West
ern wool growers and houses handling
domestic wool, especially the former,
are ready for the change. Sales for
the week have been smaller and made
up mostly of low grades. Quarter-blood
territories have made a new low
mark, probably owing to the very low
prices accepted by the government for
low quarter-bloods at last week's auc
tion. Some New Zealand and Aus
tralian crossbreds have aleo changed
hands, mostly going to spinners of
sweater and other knitting yams.
Manufacturers are not yet ready to
buy freely, either wool or yarns, as
they say they are gettingno orders
that will warrant operating on a larg
er, scale. Slow but steady improve
ment is .predicted, hftwever, many be
lieving that the market is at the low
est.possible point Bradstreets, ,

METEOR MOUNT
IS EXPLAINED
BY A SCIENTIST
(The following article by David H.
Boot, for the Iowa Academy of Sci
ence, sent The Sun by the author,
will be of interest to bcople here who
are well acquainted with the big cra
ter caused by the meteor.)
One of the greatest natural curiosi
ties in the world, though very little
known, is Meteor mountain, which is
located about forty miles southeast
of the town of Flagstaff, Arizona, and '
about ten miles south of the town of
Sunshine, Arizona, that is, it is lo
cated in the north centra) part of the
state. It is said by the' men of the
United States ""geological survey to be
probably the most mysterious geo
logical feature pf the United States,
lacking, as it does, all parallel any
where in the world, and its exact
cause being held in doubt by many
geologists. But after visiting and in
vestigating the site and examining
the records of the mining operators
who have worked there, and viewing
the many large and small fragments
of meteoric iron found in and about
the crater the author is quite sure
that the general opinion that it is the
work of a giant meteor is correct
This monster meteor must have fall
en ages ago, for the wind-blown sands
of the great American desert have
drifted in over the high walls of the
rim ""splash"" and have filled the pit
above the meteor to a depth of at least
eight hundred feet, that being the
least depth, as shown by the miner's
daily ""log"", to the solid material at
the south edge of the pit Borings :
very much deeper than this at the
center of the pit failed to reach the
buried meteor, probably because it en
tered the earth at an angle. There
still remains six hundred feet of un
filled pit, and the time elapsed since
the meteor fell may be dimly guessed
at by the very slight meteorite found
scattered about led to extensive min
ing operations, the miners hoping to
reach the great bulk of iron ore be
lieved to be in the pit bottom. Sev
eral things have operated to prevent
success, one of the worst being the
fine, wind-blown sand, at least eight ,
hundred feet deep in the crater, which
is very difficult to keep out of the min
ing shafts, because being dry and very
fine, it runs very freely. Another dif
ficulty is lack of all timber in the
neighborhood. A worse trouble is to
tal absence of water for many miles,
while a fourth difficulty is the terrible,
heat in the bottom of the pit, as the
writer can testify from experience;
the vertical walls six hundred feet
high, shutting off all air currents and
the clear sky of the Arizona desert'
working terrific effects with the bril
liant sun of the .southwest Very
many fragments of the meteoric rock
were examined by the author, the
largest weighing eighteen hundred'
pounds, being so heavy that three
strong men were unable to turn it
over. These are carefully kept under
guard by themining company, which
still controls trj spot, and except on
the rarest occasions are nearly all'
locked in a heavy stone building on""'
the north rim of the crater.

BRADSTREEf S SAYS STATE
OF TRADE QUIETER
Cooler"" - weather helps retailers
slightly, but primary and secondary
lines still complain of only hand-to-mouth
buying. Price reductions, gen
erally speaking, continue to be affect
ed by financial necessities as well as
by hope of attracting buyers. Major
ity of prices lower on week, though
food index is up. Industry quieter as
unfilled orders are being run off. Pig
iron, soft coal and coke lower, as are
wheat and cotton. Dairy products and
hogs higher. Wheat exports, partly '
from Canada, large. Better export ,
buying in copper Teported. Failures
fewer for week, due to holiday.
Monthly returns show increases over

""A MAN AND HIS WIFE""
An Intensely Interesting Story of Wide Appeal by the Author of ""The Fortunes

loed him dearly. Perhaps this was
one reason she bad a sense of chagrin
"" nen any jar occurred to mar tne calm
of their united lives. Like many other
-n omen, she had supposed that marriage
o the man one loved spelt perfect hap
piness. If one were not happier married
than tingle, -then why marry?
To the woman to whom happiness is
th. goal there come many periods of
disillusionment, and such a one had
come to Isabel today.
It was at the breakfast table. Xanv
tonjuga! disputes originate at the
'reakfast table, as all wedded couples
know. John remarked that the cream
for the cereal was thin and watery in
appearance.
""One doesn't get such cream now
adays as we used to hae when I was
a boy."" he observed. His dark eyes
were not as bright as they were whoa
ho smiled, and his well shaped moi'th
wore a discontented curve.
""We don't buy pure cream,"" Isabel
told him. ""but use what cream comes
off the top of the bottle of milk. I
had to let Cynthia open the bottle as
soon as it came this morxlng. so ths
cream did not have time to rise.
""Was there no railk left over from
last nisht?"" John queried.
He asked the Question not because
he cared especially, but because he

should thinktthat would be enough for
any cooking and to leave some over for
the next morning-. I cant imagine what

It was not .ike him to be so petty,
his wife reflected.
""What is the matter with you. .John""
she said. ""We have been married for
six months and you have never before
accused me of dissipating- in milk.'

really a bit amused. And her husband.
ne tried to laugh, but she was not
hearing the laugh, knew that she was
vexed. All at once it seemed to him
preposterous that he, the man who put
up the money to run their small estab
lishment, should be reproved for asking
things he had a Derfect right to know.
He set down his coffee cup and looked
across the table sternly. The fact that
his wife was nretty: that her eyes were
very blue and her cheeks very pink, and
that her hair waved bewitchingly about
her face d(4 not soften his heart. For
there was in those blue eyes a gleam
that was not of tenderness.
""Really, Isabel."" he said slowly, yet J
with an emphasis that betokened dls-
pleasure, since i pay tor me materials

you be surprised if I occasionally take
the liberty of making an inquiry or
two with regard to the way in whL'b

""If I overdrew my housekeeping al

know that ach month I have a llttl
something left from .it.""
""And you know that I have never
asked you what you do or mean to do
with a penny of that 'little something.
John reminded her. ""It is vonra to
penses or bills that I am supposed to
meet. It is yours to spend lust as vou
should resent my inquiring about the
quantity of milk we buy. and what be-'
comes of It""
The wife sighed. ""Well."" she said.
""I only know that the milk' goes. Yes

Covert doth has been the novelty In
winter suits and is very popular in the
spring, for it is light in color and com
bines with many things. A new cloth
called buckskin covert Is the newest
of this type.
A few days ago I received announce
ment cards from a Fifth r.venue dress
making establishment of a private view
of their newest models. From the gen
eral salesrooms I was guided into a
gray and gold elevator and from there
to an artistic room also in gray and
white and gold. The simplest of small
stages occupied one side of the room.
A few chairs were placed carelessly
around the room, and we made our
selves comfortable for theTeview.
Boleros were the most striking fea
tures shown. Short little bobby, sleeve
leas Jackets, some cut square and
straight around, others scalloped or
slashed. These were worn over full
blonsec which Moused a trifle over the
belt or girdle Insteaa of being pulled
straight down. Most ot these wore long
sleeved, while others bad the bell
sleeves, threequarter or half length,
wide and unbound at the lower edge.
The skirts were fun and short, most
of them being built on peasant lines.
witb full apron like overskirts front
and back, divided on the sides and
showing a pli.ii- or ruffled underskirt
beneath.
Another noticeable feature in these
dresses was the fact that they were all
made with a normal waistline, an in
teresting fact when one thinks of alt
the long waisted and Empire lines which
are shown as forerunners of spring and
.Summer fashions. It is a fact that"" the
frocks made on Empire lines are de-

round-waisted frocks suit -all styles of
figure more or less.
Another type of costume shown here
was taken from the 15th Century
French costumes. The waist was in
doublet effect, slashed several times
front and back through which the
creamy white chiffon blouse peeped.
A short pleated pepiura finished the
lower edge of the waist .This was
worn over a full skirt with a pleated
ruffle on the bottom. An interesting,
thing to remember Is. that these pleated
ruffles which are used en the bottom of
so many skirts are pressed flat and pnt
on the lower edge without a heading of
any kind.
In these dresses the long runic was
shown in tninv different tvlea Sjim

IP TOl"" have your own living to

We are not wnolly free from snob
bishness and the spirit of caste, but
in all the world around there is no land
where honest work carries less of a
stigma, where men and women are
taken at their own intrinsic value, than
in this unapproached and unapproacn-
able American republic.

Some women regard work as a dis
agreeable necessity never giving con
sideration to its dignity and nobility,
never realizing that in toil alone is to
be found the only real happiness.
Richard Jeffries. jn one of his sketch
es, tells of meeting three women field
workers whom he envied for their
health. ""There was that in their
cheeks."" says he. ""which all the wealth
of Ixmdon could not purchase; a superb
health in their earriage princesses
could not obtain. Jeffries envied these
women, but they envied him more:
hatred flashed in their eyes and in their
hearts, the cursed him because they
had to work while he seemed to be Idle.

were two box-pleated frills of white
chiffon. The effect was stunning.
Contrast is a strong note hi the color
combinations of the season. Many Bark
Jackets wer shown with white-or fight
colored skirts. Wide leather belts were
used on some of the dresses. One white
serge dress had a red patent leather
belt which was very effective indeed.
A white chiffon afternoon dress
showed the raglan sleeves with surplice
fronts of filet lace and a loose panel of
the filet lace in the back. The unusual
skirt was made of chiffon with three
graduated bands of shirred silk applied.
Each band was shirred upon a cord top
and bottom which gave the band a very
pretty finish.
A mode which Is having quite a
vogue and is both graceful and effect

a trouser skirt, far be it! There Is a

A coat and a dress showing the long

with pockets upon each side is a late

In the illustration the coat is worn with
a sand-colored skirt.

long-waisted appearance by a panel

waist and hips rather closely combining
very well wfth the full flaring skirt.
On many of these dresses where a
little color is needed to give the proper
note for contrast a corsage bouauet was
used. There, are many different kinds
of these flowers, those made from Vel

of ribbon. The newest ones show a

One of tiie greatest of all mysteries

of the solid bodies called meteorite!

A magnificent collection of the larg

and science
A photograph of one of these huge

a forest about 1 miles south of Port

Expert investigation showed that the
I mass was a gigantic meteorite, the
largest ever found in the United states.
One of the finders had the meteorite
removed to his ranch? but the owner
of the land on which It had fallen
brought suit for its recovery, and the
supreme court of ' Oregon, after a de
termined legal contest, returned this
gift from the skies to its original pos

Mrs. William E. Dodge secured the
great meteorite for the museum.

Tntre are two kinds of these bodies
iron, meteorites and stony meteorites.
The former always consist of about It

percent of shekel, and often confining
in minute quantity, two or three oOret -
substances, such as cobalt, phosphorus
and carbon. Even the stony meteorites
almost Invariably contain scattered
grains of nickel-iron.
The piece And manner of the origin
of the meteorites is purely conjectural,
and manv theories have been proposed.
Some have thought that they may have
been ejected, ages ago. from the now
extinct -lolcanoes of the moon, which
look as if they had been incomparably
more powerful than those known on
the earth.
Others have suggested that they may
have been thrown out of former vol
canoes of the earth, and stiU .others
sought in the sun, or in the more dis
tant suns wnutb we can stars, it naa
even been suggested hat they are the
fragments of a planet that has been
Mown to pieces. This suggestion rests
largely upon the carious fact of their
great massiveness. Because they are
so solid and heavy, it is said, they
have once formed part of a very mas
sive body.
As to the possibility of their origin
from explosions i nthe sun, or front
volcanoes. It is easy to account for
that as far as the forces needed ta
hurl them away into space are con
cerned. A simple calculation enablet
us to tell with what velocity a body
of any klaej Would need to start -from

Another type of costume shown here

creamy white chiffon blouse peeped.
A short pleated pepiura finished the
lower edge of the waist .This was
worn over a full skirt with a pleated

thing to remember Is. that these pleated
ruffles which are used en the bottom of
so many skirts are pressed flat and pnt

We are not wnolly free from snob

in all the world around there is no land
where honest work carries less of a
stigma, where men and women are
taken at their own intrinsic value, than
in this unapproached and unapproacn-
able American republic.

Some women regard work as a dis

never realizing that in toil alone is to
be found the only real happiness.
Richard Jeffries. jn one of his sketch

workers whom he envied for their
health. ""There was that in their

were two box-pleated frills of white
chiffon. The effect was stunning.
Contrast is a strong note hi the color
combinations of the season. Many Bark
Jackets wer shown with white-or fight
colored skirts. Wide leather belts were
used on some of the dresses. One white
serge dress had a red patent leather
belt which was very effective indeed.
A white chiffon afternoon dress
showed the raglan sleeves with surplice
fronts of filet lace and a loose panel of
the filet lace in the back. The unusual
skirt was made of chiffon with three
graduated bands of shirred silk applied.
Each band was shirred upon a cord top
and bottom which gave the band a very
pretty finish.
A mode which Is having quite a
vogue and is both graceful and effect
ive has been inspired bv the Tnrktob

a trouser skirt, far be it! There Is a
foundation skirt made shorter than tho

A coat and a dress showing the long

with pockets upon each side is a late
and practical model for the Spring coat.
In the illustration the coat is worn with
a sand-colored skirt.
In plain nnd moire taffeta Is the
dress illustrated made in the latest
basque effect. The bodice is given the
long-waisted appearance by a panel
front which is cut in one with, a wMe
crushed girdle. This fits around the
waist and hips rather closely combining
very well wfth the full flaring skirt.
On many of these dresses where a
little color is needed to give the proper
note for contrast a corsage bouauet was
used. There, are many different kinds
of these flowers, those made from Vel

of ribbon. The newest ones show a

One of the finders had the meteorite

Tntre are two kinds of these bodies
iron, meteorites and stony meteorites.
The former always consist of about It

percent of shekel, and often confining
in minute quantity, two or three oOret -
substances, such as cobalt, phosphorus
and carbon. Even the stony meteorites
almost Invariably contain scattered
grains of nickel-iron.
The piece And manner of the origin
of the meteorites is purely conjectural,
and manv theories have been proposed.
Some have thought that they may have
been ejected, ages ago. from the now
extinct -lolcanoes of the moon, which
look as if they had been incomparably
more powerful than those known on
the earth.
Others have suggested that they may
have been thrown out of former vol
canoes of the earth, and stiU .others
sought in the sun, or in the more dis
tant suns wnutb we can stars, it naa
even been suggested hat they are the
fragments of a planet that has been
Mown to pieces. This suggestion rests
largely upon the carious fact of their
great massiveness. Because they are
so solid and heavy, it is said, they
have once formed part of a very mas
sive body.
As to the possibility of their origin
from explosions i nthe sun, or front
volcanoes. It is easy to account for
that as far as the forces needed ta
hurl them away into space are con
cerned. A simple calculation enablet
us to tell with what velocity a body
of any klaej Would need to start -from

A few days ago I received announce
ment cards from a Fifth r.venue dress
making establishment of a private view
of their newest models. From the gen

gray and gold elevator and from there
to an artistic room also in gray and
white and gold. The simplest of small
stages occupied one side of the room.
A few chairs were placed carelessly
around the room, and we made our
selves comfortable for theTeview.
Boleros were the most striking fea
tures shown. Short little bobby, sleeve

straight around, others scalloped or
slashed. These were worn over full
blonsec which Moused a trifle over the
belt or girdle Insteaa of being pulled

sleeves, threequarter or half length,
wide and unbound at the lower edge.
The skirts were fun and short, most
of them being built on peasant lines.

Another noticeable feature in these
dresses was the fact that they were all
made with a normal waistline, an in
teresting fact when one thinks of alt
the long waisted and Empire lines which
are shown as forerunners of spring and
.Summer fashions. It is a fact that"" the

Another type of costume shown here
was taken from the 15th Century
French costumes. The waist was in
doublet effect, slashed several times
front and back through which the
creamy white chiffon blouse peeped.
A short pleated pepiura finished the
lower edge of the waist .This was
worn over a full skirt with a pleated
ruffle on the bottom. An interesting,
thing to remember Is. that these pleated
ruffles which are used en the bottom of
so many skirts are pressed flat and pnt
on the lower edge without a heading of
any kind.

were two box-pleated frills of white
chiffon. The effect was stunning.
Contrast is a strong note hi the color
combinations of the season. Many Bark
Jackets wer shown with white-or fight
colored skirts. Wide leather belts were
used on some of the dresses. One white
serge dress had a red patent leather
belt which was very effective indeed.
A white chiffon afternoon dress
showed the raglan sleeves with surplice
fronts of filet lace and a loose panel of
the filet lace in the back. The unusual
skirt was made of chiffon with three
graduated bands of shirred silk applied.
Each band was shirred upon a cord top
and bottom which gave the band a very
pretty finish.
A mode which Is having quite a
vogue and is both graceful and effect

A coat and a dress showing the long

with pockets upon each side is a late
and practical model for the Spring coat.
In the illustration the coat is worn with
a sand-colored skirt.
In plain nnd moire taffeta Is the
dress illustrated made in the latest
basque effect. The bodice is given the
long-waisted appearance by a panel
front which is cut in one with, a wMe
crushed girdle. This fits around the
waist and hips rather closely combining
very well wfth the full flaring skirt.
On many of these dresses where a
little color is needed to give the proper
note for contrast a corsage bouauet was
used. There, are many different kinds
of these flowers, those made from Vel

of ribbon. The newest ones show a

Tntre are two kinds of these bodies
iron, meteorites and stony meteorites.
The former always consist of about It

percent of shekel, and often confining
in minute quantity, two or three oOret -
substances, such as cobalt, phosphorus
and carbon. Even the stony meteorites
almost Invariably contain scattered
grains of nickel-iron.
The piece And manner of the origin
of the meteorites is purely conjectural,
and manv theories have been proposed.
Some have thought that they may have
been ejected, ages ago. from the now
extinct -lolcanoes of the moon, which
look as if they had been incomparably
more powerful than those known on
the earth.
Others have suggested that they may
have been thrown out of former vol
canoes of the earth, and stiU .others
sought in the sun, or in the more dis
tant suns wnutb we can stars, it naa
even been suggested hat they are the
fragments of a planet that has been
Mown to pieces. This suggestion rests
largely upon the carious fact of their
great massiveness. Because they are
so solid and heavy, it is said, they
have once formed part of a very mas
sive body.
As to the possibility of their origin
from explosions i nthe sun, or front
volcanoes. It is easy to account for
that as far as the forces needed ta
hurl them away into space are con
cerned. A simple calculation enablet
us to tell with what velocity a body
of any klaej Would need to start -from

Aside from this it is a wise thing to

NEW YORK, Aug 12 W— Trading
in the stock market was demoralized
today by collapse of several pool
specialties following the failure of a
stock of a stock exchange firm. Ex
treme breaks of 10 to nearly 25 points
took place in about a dozen volative
issues, while the seasoned dividend
naying railroad and industrial shares
sold down 2 to 10 points. So great
was the volume of trading that the
final quotations did not appear on the
ticker tape until 26 minutes after the
market had closed, the day’s sales
falling just below 3,000,000 shares.
IThe stock exchange failure, the first
in more than two years, was the di
rect aftermath of the sensational col
lapse yesterday in the common stock

of the Manhattan Electrical Supply
Co. Stocks were being well supported
when the suspension of the firm was
announced from the rostrom of the
exchange. Selling orders soon appear
ed in large volume, particularly in is
sues known to be under pool sponsor
ship, and their execution resulted in
the touching off of numerous “stop
loss” orders, bringing about a wide
open break.
Little attention was paid by the
market to outside news developments.
Credit conditions continued easy de
spite the announcement last night of
a further increase of more than $lB,-
000,000 in brokers’ loans to a new
high level for all time. Banks called
about $10,000,000 in loans and several
of them issued more stringent regula
tions regarding collateral on those al
ready in force.
General Motors initial response to
the proposed 2 for 1 stock split up
was disappointing, the stock opening
1% points lower at 219% and then
rallying down to 219. Subsequently
the stock sold as high as 224, then
crashed to 216%, closing at 218%.
Manhattan Electrical Supply opened
at 61, advanced to 64%, broke to 50%,
a new low for the year as compared
with the recent high and closed at 56.
Eureka Vacuum broke from a high of j
74% to 50, and then rallied to 69, ofl j
4% net. Other sharp 'breaks took j
place in Houston, which dropped from j
133% to 112; Air Reduction from 184

to 163; White Sewing Machine from
48% to 34; Pittsburgh Coal from 59 %
to 50 and Timken Roller Bearing from
129% to 121%. Several of these made
substantial recoveries from a low level.
Rails also were heavily liquidated
with the largest losses being recorded
in southwestern merger issues and
eastern coalers. Lehigh Valley, Dela
ware and Hudson, Pittsburgh and West
Virginia, Western Maryland, Texas and
Pacific, Soo common, Katy common
and wabash, closed 3 to 6 points net
lower.
Time money and commercial paper
rates held firm.
Foreign exchange trading was quiet
with little change in quotations. De
mand sterling and French francs ruled
around 4.85% and 3.91% cents, re
spectively. Japanese yen were heavy.
The commodity markets were reac
tionary in sympathy with the decline
in stock prices. Wheat futures yield
ed only a fraction of a cent per bushel.
Cotton futures closed 18 to 28 points
net lpwer.

COINS WORD ‘AERODYNE”
LONDON.—The British air ministry
has coined a new word, “aerodyne,” to
replace the words “heavier than air”
in describing any flying craft which
derives its support dynamically from
the reaction on surfaces in motion.
The word has been approved by the
international commission for air navi
gation.
COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK, Aug. 12 W-IThe cot
ton market was very nervous and
irregular today. There was some buy
ing on apprehension of unfavorable
weather conditions over the week-end,
but rallies met further realizing on
liquidation. There may have been
some Wall street selling on the un
settled tone reported in the stock
market.
December sold off to 19.40 or 30 to
35 points net lower, but was steadied
at that figure by covering with the
mid-afternoon market showing rallies
of several points from the lowest.

January, 19.43.

! GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, Aug. 12 m— Nervousness
’ pervaded the wheat market today, and
prices averaged lower despite strong
rallies at times. Weakness of stocks
in New York had a bearish influence.
Closing quotations on wheat were un
settled at %c to %c net decline, with
corn showing %c to lc advance, oats
%c to %c up, provisions unchanged
to 20c down.
Upturns in wheat were hard to
maintain. Selling on the part of hold
ers and from speculators for a de
cline met every advance, and frus
trated determined efforts to lift the
market. Late buying of wheat in the
face of weakness of stocks was based
a good deal on field conditions north
west regarded as- likely to promote
black rust damage. Besides unsatis
factory weather' in Europe and rela
tive firmness of Liverpool wheat quo
tations were of some effect. Too much
rain, especially in France and England,
was reported to be interfering with !
the European harvest and pointing to j
need of more liberal purchasing from
North America.
Export buying of 288,000 bushels of
I wheat here today was announced, and
j the seaboard advised of 300,000 bushels
! taken today for shipment to Europe.
; in addition, vessel room was chartered
j here for 180,000 bushels of wheat to
|go to Montreal. Export demand here
j was the best in some time, with more
! wheat wanted than was actually
! bought, and with a better basis gen
-1 erally paid, cash wheat being un
changed to lc up.
Illinois and lowa crop reports were
bullish on corn, and there were more
reports in regard to the corn borer.
Oats advices in most cases told of
smaller yields than expected.
Provisions were easier on account of
scattered selling.
METEORITE FALLS
NEAR GERMAN VILLAGE
BERLIN. (A 1 ) —The villagers of Glue
sing in the province of Brunswick were
much frightened recently when a ball
of fire came tearing through the ad
jacent forest and exploded with a loud
report.
Headed by the chief forester, a party
set out for the place where the fiery
ball seemed to have touched the
groiund. They found a meteorite of
considerable size. *

lfOIV THE MIGHTY lb rALLUN
When Theodore Roosevelt was In Texas
recruiting his famous regiment ot Hough
Itlilora ho smiled his way into the gool
graces ot Texans as commandlngly as a
cowboy with a reputation tor bolng bandy
with his true stalks Into a bordero camp
Mors tbsd this ho made n nivh and
Texas newspapers patted him on U10
i > aik nntl proudly called him our Teddy
VThey followed him and his regiment to
Cuba and when si El Caney ho dasb < sd
Uko an unleashed war do at tho blood
thirsty Ppantard they senl tho Asso
ciated Tress iseVeml bettor In tolling tho
country what an Incomparable hero our
Teddy was Later when ho wont up
against the Piatt machine for the republi
can nomination lor governet ot tho
State of Jfcw York as recklessly as ho
had Bono up against the yawning Jaws
of Uootly death democrattte Texas could
cot help wishing him well since they
didnt ocllove New York could elect a
democratic governor no bow Texas
wouldnt believe the our Teddy was
n tax dodger Ho was too brave to dodge
anything not even a cyclone When ho
tvhs elected and Inaugurated Texas smiled
and bared its molars Just as It had seen
Teddy do end Teddy smiled back at dear
o the declaration made for < luban Indepen
dence there would have been no serious dis
turbance In the Philippines and that we
would now be In the peaceful possession of
the archipelago as we are la contrpl ot
Cuba t believe It Is not too late even how
to make that broad declaration of our policy
adBurlng tlomestla control of Internal nffalrs
combined with the guaranteo of Independence
whenever In the opinion of this government
the Filipinos are able to administer a govern
ment which will protect life secure properly
maintain law and order and meet the de
mands of civilization
Has any democratic nntlexpnnslonlst
over contended for any other disposition
ot the Philippine problem than this And
yet the Newses by garbled extracts from
Mr Howells speech attempt to nrray
film and Incidentally his paper against
the leaders of tho democratic party whom
they denounco ta undeveloped young
politicians nnd narrowminded office
seekers
Tho American Federation of Labor can
hot be said to bo composed ot young
democratic politicians nor of harrow
minded old offlccsoekcrs Yet American
labor has sounded tho alarm and arrayed
Itself against a policy of territorial ex
pansion that no man not blind to rea
son can deny will expose It to tho hurt
ful competition of cheap labor and put
upon his brawn the burden In large part
of sustaining a iremendous standing army
Who but tbe American farmer Is to sus
tain tho rest ot this burden And when
tho American farmer comes to see as be
surely will that tho Philippine Islands
will give him a rival In tho production
of cotton nnd other staples that will
crowd his surplus out ot tbe markets of
tho world he too will stand up along
side of organlred labor and strike down
the military satrapy on American
thought that Is spurring this country Into
the snares ot Imperialism
Lot these expansionists who lay unto
their own tremendous vanity the pleasing
conceit that they nlono understand the
needs and progress of the Nation as those
thlnes touch the pockets and firesides
of the man In tho workshops and on the
fsrms get down to simple figures OIa
us something that ordinary minds not
used to tho Jingle of spurs and tbe flash
of swords can understand Put down on
ono side If they are able nnd honest
125000000 a year to maintain a standing
army of 100000 men Write down tho
end of Insurrections aad revolutions of
a people that the logic of history tells us
will last as long under the new master
as they did under the old who sold them
and tholr country like a chattel mortgage
to the United States Set down like
wise the lmmonso acreage that will be
opened up to tho production of 2 cent
cotton and last but not least give tho
whole population cltisonshlp In the United
States with tho privilege of pouring Into
tho Western hemisphere an avalanche ot
cheap labor Then go back and get
down again to honest accounting and set
down In the opposing column tho extent
and value of tbe commerce these new and
distant acquisitions will open up to the
South and the Western hemisphere Show
that trusts and combines and syndicates
iwlll be tho beneficiaries and that even
Time grew apace and Teddy t sgan to Southern cotton mills obeying the same
swagger about Borne Now 1 there Is law ot economics that mado them quit
anything on earth that a Texan wont the barren hills of Now England will
stand It la a swaggerer and when to abandon tho South to tske up their f Hure
swagger Is added roountcbanklsrn Texas

INDIANS OF MANY TRIBES WILL BE HERE
FAMOUS HOPI MARATHON RACERS ARE COMING
Arizona Wool Growers Association
Meets Here Tuesday and Wednesday
for Forty-first Annual Convention
POLICE ARE PUZZLED
BY OUTBREAK OF HOME
ROBBERIES PAST WEEK
Someone ■will have to do some tall
explaining if he opens a second-hand
store in Flagstaff following on the
heels of three home burglaries here
within the past week which have puz
zled police investigators by the ap
parent lack of clues.
Tuesday evening of this week police
officers were called to the home of
Mr. and Mrs. CarT Dickinson on West
Birch avenue. They reported that
during their absence at the picture
show their home had been entered and
all their clothes stolen. Entrance was
through a rear door which had been
left unlocked. Besides the clothes the
thief had not molested anything but a
cheap watch. Mr. Dickinson places
the loss at approximately S3OO.
Early Saturday evening the resi
dence of D. E. Hart near Teachers
college was broken into by removing a
screen and jimmying and a few per
sonal belongings taken. The loss was
about SSO.
Last week Wednesday night, the
home of W. H. Thompson was en
tered by a sneak thief between the
hours of eight and nine and approxi
mately SSOO worth of personal be
longings taken. No trace of the rob
ber has been found, although Satur
day morning city police were notified
of several clothes hangers which
were found on the hill at the end of
Aspen avenue just north of E. D.
Babbitt Motor company’s camp
ground. Members of the Thompson
family identified the hangers as taken
with wearing apparel from their home.
As yet no tangible clue has been
found on which police can work,' says
J. R. Cooper, city marshal. That the
three robberies were committed by
the same person or persons is certain
in the minds of investigators. In all
three cases burnt matches, evidently
used for lighting, were found strewn
about the houses. The time in each
case is also fixed at between eight
and nine in the evening. Whoever com
mits the burglaries is evidently fa
miliar with the actions of the occu
pants of the houses and seems to
know just when to strike.
Beautiful Celestial
Displays Witnessed
Here Last Saturday
Residents of this vicinity were
treated to a brilliant but not rare ce
lestial display Saturday morning when
two beautiful halos, popularly called
sun dogs, were visible. One of the
halos was at 22 degrees and was the
most noticeable, while one at 46 de
grees was somewhat obscured by the
sun.
The display, very clearly visible
Saturday for from 11:30 to noon, is
not properly a sun dog. In astron
omical circles it is called a halo and is
formed from ice crystals or drops of
water in the atmosphere. The light
passing through these crystals or
drops of water is refracted the same
as when passed through a spectrum
and a halo is the result.
Halos as were seen last Saturday
and Sunday are not at all rare, but
it is seldom one is as brilliant as the
display on those two days. The vari
ous colors of the spectrum at times
were very plainly visible.
It is said that one resident of Flag
staff called the Lowell observatory
Saturday when the halos were the
brightest and asked if it was the
Pons-Winnecke comet coming near the
earth. The caller was reassured that
it wasn’t.
“Most Fascinating”
Spot 18 Discovered
The most fascinating spot on earth,
according to D. Moreau Barringer,
Jr., writing in the current issue of the
Scientific American, is a hole four
fifths of a mile in diameter and 445
feet deep not far from Flagstaff,
where a meteorite has plowed itself
into the earth. More meteorites have
fallen in the vicinity of this hole than
at any other place on the earth’s sur
face, the author says. Excavations and
drillings have been made in the hole
in an attempt to locate the meteorite.
Attempts so far have not been suc
cessful, although there is every indi
cation that the meteorite may be found
at a depth of approximately 1,300 feet,
the author says.
JUDGE ARMSTRONG HERE
Judge Thomas Armstrong Jr., for
many years one of the chief members
of the legal fraternity of Phoenix, ac
companied by Mrs. Armstrong and
Miss Dasie Johnson of Denver, a sister
of Mrs. Armstrong, were Fourth of
July guests in Flagstaff.
Single Copy 10 Cents
The 41st annual convention of the
Arizona Wool Growers association
will be held in this city next Tuesday
and Wednesday, July 12 and 13. A. A.
Johns of Prescott, president of the
association, will open the meeting
Tuesday morning at 10 with the an
nual presidential address. All ses
sions of the convention will be held
in the Woman’s club building on As
pen avenue.
This is the 38th meeting of the
Wool Growers to be held in Flagstaff
since the organziation of the associa
tion 41 years ago. Os the three other
conventions one was in Prescott, one
in Winslow and one in Holbrook. By
virtue of the fact that Coconino
county is the center of the sheep in
dustry in the state, the articles of in
corporation of the association now
provide that all annual meetings shall
be held in Flagstaff.
According to Lt.-Col. Harry B. Em
bach this will be one of the most suc
cessful annual meetings of the asso
ciation. About 75 sheep men from
every section of the state will be pres
ent. Col. Embach says that approxi
mately 95 per cent of the sheepmen
of the state are members of the asso
ciation.
Both convention days will be de
voted to business, the only social event
being a dinner-dance on Tuesday
night at the Woman’s club. The ses
sions are scheduled to close late
Wednesday afternoon.
Governor Hunt has been extended
an invitation to Attend the convention
and deliver an address, but has given
no definite answer to Col. Embach’s
invitation.
Besides the regular business meet
ing and election of officers, the speak
ers will include: George T. Wixling
myer, of the U. S. department of ag
riculture. Mr. Willingmyer is prob
ably the greatest known authority on
wool fibres and standards and only re
cently completed a trip around the
world in which he gathered much
valuable data on the subject.
A. W. Hilyard, representing the
Boston wool market will speak on the
marketing of wool from the stand
point of the buyer.
Dean J. J. Thornber, head of the
College of Agriculture, University of
Arizona, will speak on the relationship
existing between the college and the
sheep industry.
Charles E. Blaine, traffic attorney
for the association, Phoenix, will talk
on railroad rates.
Fred P. Cruice, Los Angeles, as
sistant general freight agent of the
Santa Fe railroad, will discuss freight
rates as applied to the sheep indus
try.
Russell P. Kyle, district freight and
passenger agent of the Southern
Pacific, will discuss freight rates and
their application to the marketing of
wool and sheep.
R. B. Sims, chairman state indus
trial commission, will speak on indus
trial insurance and discuss the work
men’s compensation act as passed by
the Seventh legislature.
Vernon Vaughn, state land com
missioner, Phoenix, will discuss state
land problems.
P. G. Spilsbury, president Arizona
Industrial Congress, will speak on
state industries and their relation to
each other.
H. V. Watson, president Arizona
Live Stock Loan company of Flag
staff, will discuss the wool market.
Mayor I. B. Koch, Flagstaff, will
deliver an address of welcome.

children and Mrs. Hillhouse’s sister of
Philadelphia arrived here the last of
the week in their car on their way to
Phoenix, where Mr. Hillhouse has been
appointed special assistant to Dr. Rule
of the Presbyterian church. Rev.
Hillhouse has a passel of friends here,
made while he assisted Carl Mayhew
in his studio a couple years ago. Since
then he had been in the east collecting
another degree at a theological semi
nary, which makes him a flock of
them. He decided when he left here
to return to Arizona, and Springer
ville was delegated to him until the
appointment came from Dr. Rule. The
party spent Sunday at Mr. Mayhew’s
Oak Creek lodge. Rev. Hillhouse dur
ing the war was orderly to Lieut.
Mayhew when the latter had charge
of the allied armies photographic bu
reau in Paris.
NEGRAYS OVERTURNED
Mr. and Mrs. George Negray and
little daughter Mercy were lucky Fri
day when their car tipped over on the
highway between Prescott and Ash
fork that they escaped unscathed. The
fenders on one side of the car were
crushed and there was a large dent in
the body, otherwise no damage. They
were traveling fast when they hit a
rock which caused a blowout. Mr.
and Mrs. Negray were on their way
here from Phoenix to spend the week
end.

CAMERON-UTAHROADIN
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET
Senator and Mrs. Henry F. Ashurst
arrived Monday from the coast and
will be here some time. They would
like to stay longer in their former
home town and visit with their old
neighbors but the senator will have to
go to Washington soon to appear be
fore the director of the bureau of the
budget with reference to several spe
cial matters. The most important of
these to Flagstaff is that concerning
the building of public roads across
Indian reservations.
Senator Ashurst is appearing espe
cially to try to induce the budget mas
ter to provide funds for the building
of the Monumental highway from
Cameron to the Utah line across the
Indian reservation. He will also ap
pear before the budget master with
reference to the Coolidge dam.
Senator Ashurst after leaving here
had a full program of addresses in
Arizona and California cities, for a
couple of weeks. At the conclusion
of this extensive lecture tour Senator
and Mrs. Ashurst sailed from San
Franqisco for the Hawaiian Islands,
where they spent an enjoyable vaca
tion.
DR. STERNHEIM DEFENDED
“BABBITT TO ROTARIANS
Dr. Emanuel Sternheim of New
York, principal speaker at Tuesday’s
Rotary meeting, held his audience
spell-bound during the half-hour or so
allotted to him. His theme was the
challenge of Sinclair Lewis’ book,
“Babbitt,” to America and Americans
to better home life, cleaner business,
more tolerance toward others, patri
otism that doesn’t concern itself so
much with flaunting our supremacy in
wealth and industry as in our leader
ship in art, literature, true home life,
business ethics, friendship and help
fulness to other nations.
Dr. Sternheim is lecturing at Flag
staff Teachers college this week. He
is a graduate of Oxford, Heidelberg
and Paris universities, w’as a member
of the London, Eng., school board for
10 years, and is special lecturer for
the University of New York on edu
cation and Americanization.
Loren Cress was chairman for the
day and arranged the program. Dr.
A. J. Mackey, president, showed the
big loving cup won by this club for
the largest attendance at the district
conference at Mesa last spring. Jim
mie Lewis, past member, now of La-
Mesa, Calif., was called upon to stand
and received a hand.
Dr. M. G. Fronske gave an interest
ing talk on Rotary administration and
P. J. Moran on qualifications for
membership.
Visiting Rotarians: Jim Felton of
Tempe, P. G. Spilsbury of Phoenix,
Parker of Trinidad, Dewey Webber
of McAllen, Tex. Guests: Dr. Stern
heim, Miss Elsa Myers, Alan Powers,
Jimmie Lewis, Cecil Miller of Glen
dale, Ray Cow'den of Phoenix, Mr.

Plan 1928 Pageant
For Grand Canyon
The plan to produce the Grand
Canyon pageant in the summer of
1928 is meeting with great enthusiasm
in the northern part of the state.
Mrs. Katherine Mcßae, of Coolidge,
is general manager of the Arizona
Pageantry association, under whose
ouspices the pageant at the Grand
Canyon is to be produced.
It is the present plan of the asso
ciation to hold the pageant either in
June or July, 1928, at the Grand
Canyon national park. The organiza
tion plans to form an association of
men in the northern part of the state
to assume the responsibilities of the
pageant in the same manner that an
association was formed in the south
ern part of the state to sponsor the
first Arizona pageant at the Casa
Grande ruins.
The association also proposes to
build a second Indian village at the
Grand Canyon similar to the one that
is being planned for the Casa Grande
ruins that the art and architecture of
the Arizona Indians may be perpet
uated at the Grand Canyon. Chris
Totten, chief of the Smoki dancers of
Prescott has offered the cooperation
of the Smoki dancers in the work.
The officials of the Santa Fe rail
road have accepted the plan, Mrs.
Mcßae states, and it is hoped that
soon plans will be under way for this
second state pageant. It is the aim
to make the Grand Canyon pageant
an annual affair.
FLAGSTAFF, ARIZONA, FRIDAY, JULY 8, 1927
Company T To
Go Into Camp On
Mexican Border
Company “I”, 158th Infantry, the
Flagstaff national guard company,
with headquarters at the large armory
on the opposite side of Milton Road
from the Northern Arizona Teachers
college, will establish camp on the
Fort Huachuca military reservation
about ten miles from the Mexican
border on August 12.
This camp, among the valleys and
mountains rich with wild game as well
as wild and beautiful scenery, will
continue for a period of two weeks
from August 12.
The company will leave Flagstaff
via the Santa Fe railroad in a car of
its own and go to Phoenix; there the
company “I” car will be transferred
to the Southern Pacific railroad and
will pass through Casa Grande, Tuc
son and Fairbanks on its way to the
United States government military
reservation near the Mexican border.
The round trip will involve a rail
road journey of approximately seven
hundred miles.
The camp will be established in
Garden Canyon, a beautiful site in
the Huachuca mountains, on the mili
ary reservation. Screened kitchens
and shower baths have already been
constructed for all of the companies
of the 158th Infantry that will as
semble there.
During the two weeks camp the
forenoons will be used for drill; but
in the afternoons the men will have
target shooting, baseball games,
swimming and other sports. On Sat
urday afternoons and Sundays the
men may make excursions into the
surrounding country.
This is an excellent opportunity for
men between the ages of 18 and 45
years of age to take an exceptional
two weeks vacation with all expenses
paid and in addition to receive the
national guard pay which amounts to
about two dollars pir day.
Company “I” has vacancies for
about twenty-five men for this trip.
Those who are desirous of taking
the trip should see Captain John Mat
thews at the Tissaw Electric Shop, 17
E Aspen Ave., or telephone No. 395.
They should see Captain Matthews
or telephone him as soon as possible
so thpt he may be able to make all
arrangements for transportation and
all other details for the accommoda
tion and comfort of the men.
STATE POLITICIAN IS
HURT WHEN CAR TURNS
OVER NEAR THIS CITY
Louis Whitney, chairman of the
state democratic committee and a
well-known Phoenix lawyer was se
verely bruised and crushed when the
car in which he was riding turned
turtle on the Old Trails highway
about nine miles this side of Williams
at 1:30 Saturday morning. The car
was driven by Larry How’e, son of
Charley Howe of the state tax com
mission. Mr. Howe suffered a few
minor bruises and a cut on his face.
Mr. Whitney was brought to the
Mercy hospital by passing motorists
and given medical attention. He is
still confined to that institution, but
will probably be released soon.
The two men were on their way
from Phoenix to Grand Canyon in Mr.
Whitney’s car to spend over the
Fourth. On rounding a curve the ma
chine struck some loose gravel and
wa§ thrown out of control, plunging
over a small embankment and turn
ing over. Mr. Howe was thrown clear
of the car. But for this fact Mr.
Whitney would probably have been
crushed to death as the weight of the
car rested on his chest. Mr. Howe
succeeded in lifting the car enough
for the stricken man to pull himself
partly out, but not far enough to get
clear. Mr. Whitney was forced to re
main under the car with the door
resting across his legs for nearly a
half hour, when passing motorists
helped to extricate him. The car was
righted and towed into Flagstaff.
Both of the men consider themselves
most fortunate that they came out of
the accident as well as they did. The
machine was badly wrecked and it will
take several hundred dollars to get it
baek into running shape.
A SlLfc SALESWOMAN
SELLING RAG PAPER
Miss Ethel Chambers, the pretty
young lady who represents one of the
most vital parts of the interior work
ings of the Phoenix branch of the
famous Blake, Moffitt & Towne cor
poration of paper constructors and
distributors, is spending a recuper
ative vacation in Flagstaff for a
couple weeks. Miss Ethel is equally
successful in selling herself and paper.
She has a beautiful line of bond—and
blonde in delicate colors which nat
urally can’t fade. While we have not
as yet looked over her line of wed
ding announcements, we are certain
the blotting paper she is
so efficacious that it will mop up and
make impossible any Reno results.
It is generally understood that the
very best matrimonial bond paper is
made of rags. We very much approve
of Blake, Moffitt & Towne’s new idea
of introducing saleswomen of silk.

GOLF TOURNEY HERE
The northern Arizona or “Santa Fe

Country club Sunday and Monday, the
third and fourth, brought many visit
ing enthusiasts, and the fine condi
tion of the links, with ideal weather
contributed to a most enjoyable two
days.
Good fellowship prevailed through

LACKOFFIRES ON 4TH
SURPRISES FIRE LADDIES
Members of the Flagstaff fire de
partment got together Tuesday morn
ing after the Fourth and asked them
selves “how come? how come? Only
one fire over the Fourth and that
can’t be absolutely laid to firecrack
ers.”
According to Chief Hogan and Jack
Irish, fire truck driver, this w r as the
quietest Fourth for the department
since Hector was a pup. Everyone
of the men was on his toes all day
Sunday and Monday awaiting fire
calls that usually result from the
celebration of the Fourth.
The only call the boys had to an
swer since last week’s issue of The
Sun was one on Coconino avenue in
the Mexican quarter where a large
pile of wood caught on fire, ostensibly
from a firecracker. The alarm was
turned in at 1:05 Saturday afternoon
by a passing pedestrian. Efforts
were made to get the fire under con
trol with chemicals from the tank on
the big fire truck to obviate the ne
cessity of laying three blocks of hose.
However, it was found necessary to
bring water to the fire. No daitiage
was done any of the buildings, several
of which were in close proximity.

NOTED SWEDISH BOTANIST
TO VISIT FLAGSTAFF
Dr. Henrik Hesselman, a distin

pected to arrive yesterday by G. A.
Pearson, director Southwest forest ex
periment station. Dr. Hesselman ie
a famous ecologist from Sweden, the
author of many works on forest ecol

relation of the growth of trees to cli

Now Can Motor Right
To Sunset Ice Caves
Do you know that you can now
drive right up to the mouth of the
Ice Caves under Sunset mountain on
a fine new road? For years past a
half mile was the nearest one could
drive. Ambitipus ones traveled the
rest of the way on Shank’s mares.
The new Sunset loop recently fin
ished by the forest service in its 60
minute fire control project, Included
the building of this stretch of road
across the lava beds from the end of
the Sunset mountain road to Sunset
crater.
There used to be an old wagon road
over the lava beds with steep pitches,
and rough going. The forest road
crews used this old route to some ex
tent, easing the old grades by taking
longer and easier ascents. They filled
up the big cracks in the lava with
coarse cinders, pounded down the
sharp points, ploughed through the
small cinder mounds with caterpillar
and grader and then surfaced the
whole with good cinders.
This road has paid for itself sev
eral times over. There have been sev
eral fires in this cinder district east
of Sunset crater, two of them right
near the road, which were easily put
out but which would have caused
heavy damage, as they did last year,
if there had been no road into that
section.

An undercurrent of expectancy, a
gradual drifting into town of strang
ers and the click of high-heeled boots
on the pavements brings one to the
realization that in just another week
Flagstaff will be in the center of the
greatest Indian tribal reunion ever
held in the state of Arizona.
Doc Pardee arrived in town Wed
nesday afternoon for a several weeks’
stay to personally take charge of the
celebration which will open next
Thursday, July 14, with the mammoth
Indian pageant. Over 500 Indians are
already lined up for the three-day
celebration with promises from more
coming in every day. Word has been
received that every Indian at The Gap
will be here, these Indians alone num
bering over 300.
There will be at least 10 tribes of
Indians represented. To stage every
known outdoor Indian sport, includ
ing horse races, chicken pulls, stone
races, flag contests, will be the aim
of the management of the reunion. An
Indian marathon race, featuring Hopi
and Navajo winners of the New Yoi'k
and Phoenix marathons will be held.
All of the races including those of
the rodeo will be hald at a specially
constructed track at City park, work
men having started on the construc
tion this week.
At one o’clock every day, a great
equestrian parade will pass through
the streets. Five hundred mounted
Indians, 300 mounted whites and 300
Indians and their families in wagons
and automobiles will make up one of
the most interesting sights ever seen
in the state. War dances will add
color and life to the parade.
Every citizen is urged by Doc Pardee
to get in the parade. Lee Doyie will
bring in 80 horses: Tom and Archie
Brown of Marshall Lake will loan ev
ery saddle horse from their ranch
while the Foxboro Prep ranch will
send 40 horses and 30 riders from the
school to take part in the parade.
Other people who care to assist in the
parade are asked to leave their names
at Reunion headquarters. All horses
which are brought in, says Doc, will
be taken care of and fed.
The International News Reel and
Pathe News will be here to secure pic
tures of the parade and other re
union features.
Cowboy Preacher Smith, “the In
dian’s friend,” will have charge of ra
tioning the provisions to the Indians
because of his wide acquaintance with
the natives. Ten beeves have been
ordered to feed the Indians who will
make camp on a hillside near town
where everyone may go and watch
them in camp.
On Wednesday a carload of buck
ing broncos, including Aimee McPher
son, Jerry Sullivan, Red Dog, Rubber
Heels, Carbolic and the Hired Girl,
were shipped from Prescott by Doc
Pardee. These famous bucking horses
are the property of Doc and are noted
for their tenacity in “getting their
man.” This will be the last time these
horses will be taken away from Pres
cott as they are being sold by Doc to
the Prescott Frontier Days associa
tion.
A few of the cowboy riders who
will compete in the rodeo contests will
be Logan and Perlie Morris, cham
pion team ropers of the 1923-24 Pres
cott Frontier Days, Lawton and George
Champie of Castle Hot Springs, the

YOUNG TUBA INDIAN GOT
8400 FOR A PAINTING
Homer Kooyama, the young Indian
who did the remarkable painting of
Cummings Mesa on the curtain of the
theatre at the Indian school at Tuba
City is becoming more and more
famed nationally. Several visitors
Saturday were astonished at its su
perb coloring, the excellent draught
manship and the masterful execution
as a whole. Common house paints, a
big brush, practically no art instruc
tion—and the picture was done in a
few weeks without making a single
change. Kooyama’s work is uniform
ly good. He was struck almost dumb
with astonishment a few weeks ago
when the curator of a big Chicago art
society offered him S4OO for a paint
ing he had done of Rainbow Bridge.
o
MANY IMPROVEMENTS
MADE AT TUBA CITY
Recent visitors to Tuba City have
noted the great improvements there
within the last few months. Concrete
sidewalks, improvement of lawns,
trimming up of orchard and shade
trees, removal of rubbish—these and
other things add to the good looks of
the little reservation city. The only
building of the old Mormon settlement
that remains is near the visitors’ dor
mitory. It was roofless and dilapi
dated. Superintendent Walker had it
re-stuccoed and an ornamental tile
roof put on. A long stone garage w r as
built entirely by the pupils, both for
utility and also to show them how to
do masonry.

TRAIN CRASHES TRUCK
HERE SATURDAY MORN;
DRIVER NOT SCRATCHED
Only a fraction of a second prob
ably saved the life of Jesse James,
driver for Robinson & Carter, fruit
wholesalers of this city, when the
truck he was driving was crashed into
by train No. 4 at the Beaver street
crossing at 5:40 Saturday morning.
The heavy truck was struck on the
front end by the cylinder of the loco
motive and shoved off the track. An
other three feet further and the ma
chine would have been hit squarely
on the cab and its driver either killed
or seriously injured.
James said that he came around the
corner from Phoenix avenue onto
Beaver street in second speed and had
just shifted to high when he saw the
train upon him. He had not noticed
the train’s approach and the noise of
his motor inside the cab made it im
possible to hear it. No watchman
was on duty at the time. James said
he applied the brakes and tried to
turn the truck sideways so as to run
down the track alongside the loco
motive but the engine hit him before
he had time. Trainmen said that they
were moving about 15 miles an hour
wljen the crash came. The train had
its brakes applied, preparatory to
stopping at the station.
The train was stopped as soon as
possible after the crash and trainmen
rushed to the assistance of James,
who crawled out of the cab of his
truck with a smile on his face. He
jocularly remarked that the engineer
ought to take a better aim the next
time. The truck remained right side
up.
Considerable damage was done to
the machine in spite of the fact that
it was only hit on the front end. An
entire new motor will be needed and
the frame was badly bent, besides
damage to the steering gear and oth
er items.
Efforts have been made by the city
council to get gates placed at the
Beaver street crossing because of the
heavy flow of traffic across that point.
During the day a guard is stationed
at the crossing but after five o’clock
there is nothing to warn cars of the
approach of a train.

City's Police Court
Takes In $3,852 In
Fines Past 6 Months
Police Magistrate Clarence T. Pul
liam for the first six months of this
year handed out fines to law vio
lators amounting to $3,852. Accord
ing to Magistrate Pulliam this is
probably the largest amount of fines
collected in any six months in the
city’s history. The large total was
brought about by the S3OO fineß
handed out violators of the city’s li
quor ordinance. Two other cases
which netted the city over SSOO were
for gambling. All of the fines are
placed in the city’s general fund.
Justice of Peace Harry Richwine
handed in his report for the first half
of 1927 and the criminal fines col
lected amounted to $525 and civil case
fees to $142.25. Os the criminal cases
SSO was derived from the fining of a
man for the unlawful shooting of a
deer and $125 for fishing without li
censes.

The regular monthly meeting of the
P. T. A. will be held at the school
house on Friday evening. The most
important action to be taken at this
time will be the installation of new |
officers which were elected at the last [
meeting. Further plans will be made
for the entertainment of guests and
delegates to the state convention to
be held here this spring.
Jim Ingram who has been in the
Santa Fe hospital in Los Angeles to
have X-rays taken of some broken
ribs, is very much improved and is j
able to be back at his position with j
the transportation.
Howard Greening went to Williams |
on Wednesday to have dental work j
done.
James Tear of Los Angeles, em- j
ployment agent for the Harvey Co., is
here relieving Mr. Patrossi, who is
in Kansas City for a short stay.
Mr. and Mrs. Robert Fran?y left for
their ranch in Apache county on Tues
day. Mr. Francy will return in the
near .future with the transportation
mules that have been pastured there
this winter. Mrs. Francy plans on
remaining indefinitely, taking full
charge of the ranch during her hus
band’s absence.
The Southland Artists gave a very
enjoyable concert at Community hall
on Tuesday evening, to a crowded j
house. Four ladies put on the pro
gram and each number showed talent
and finish. The high class of this
and other concerts this winter make
these Santa Fe reading room enter
tainments greatly appreciated by local
residents.
Mrs. G. W. Cravey returned Sunday
last from a visit of a year at her for
mer home in San Antonio, Texas. She
joined Mr. Cravey here and the last
of the week will move out to the head
of the Yaqui trail and take charge of
the camp there for the transportation
department. During her absence she
suffered a nervous breakdown and
was in a hospital for six weeks but is
much improved in health now.
Dean Tillotson was confined to his
j home by illness the first of the week
1 but is again able to be out.
i After a stay of over a week with
the Misses White and Irick at the
teacherage, Mrs. L. A. Bailey with
small daughter left for Coconino to
join her husband at the Bass ranch,
where they are now residing.
It is sincerely to be hoped that
March will soon show some of the far
famed lamb-like quality and let the
i construction work planned get under
j way. If present indications material
: ize, the average will be three* snow
i storms in two weeks, making even
preliminary preparations impossible,
i The Misses Cottolendi of Supai ar-
I rived Wednesday for a short visit with
S their brother Charley and family.
| Mr. and Mrs. Robert Walkey re
turned the middle of last week from
i Phoenix, much the worse for wear
! owing to their recent automobile ac
j cident. After recuperating for a few
days Mr. Walkey took charge of the
second trick at the power house on
Sunday. They are living at the Bright
Angel.
Mrs. L. G. Carr went to Williams
Wednesday and Thursday for a short
stay with her son Stanton.
G. B. Grouch of the field service de
partment of the Diesel Engine com
pany, left Wednesday for Beloit, Wis.
The American Legion is putting in
overtime working on a play which
will be ready for presentation some
time in April. L. G. Carr has charge
of the directing and many of our
prominent citizens will no doubt show
unexpected histrionic talent.

An exposition of the work of the
churches all over the world was well
attended and staged with success by
30 children of the bible school assis
ted by 11 students from Teachers
college Sunday, Monday and Tues
day.
Entering the church door, one was
immediately taken into an Indian ho- j
gan where Miss A. Stewart and Lois j
Brantingham told of the Indian work j
and exhibited specimens of ancient,
and modern pottery.
Turning a corner the visitor found j
himself in a forest scene where Miss
V. Rudd, Glendon McNutt, Robert
Fronske and Jim Mitchell set forth
the joys and sorrows of the lumber
jack. They later gave a sketch of
forest life on the stage. »
Next door Alaska was displayed,
showing an igloo, skin of a huskie
and specimens of Indian work from
the far north. Miss C. Jones and
Ed Turner gave the realistic touch
to this part.
Japan came next, Miss H. Owmgs, j
Rachel Softley and E. Rudd, dressed :
as Japanese, smiled in Japanese sash- j
ion and showed a tea service of genu
ine Japanese dishes and serviettes.
The Islands of the Far East, Siam
and Egypt appeared next. Miss E.
Fane and Miss Moorman in costume
and Ruth Softley as a mysterious
Eastern ladv gave the Oriental touch
amid the rising odors of incense. \
In China, Mrs. L. M. Cole, Harriet
Brantingham and Kathryn Harover,
dressed in real Chinese clothing made
one at home. There were slippers,
beads, writing and other Chinese ob
jects of real value.
India, subtle and weary, was por
trayed in the next booth. Here Miss
W. Ferris, Cordelia Brown and Don
; na Chisholm, as Hindoo ladies of var-
I ious castes received the world trip
j per. Fancy work of Hindoos, photo
i scenes took one into the heart of In-
I dia.
' Syria next surprised. The sheiks
i of the desert —Harry Rickel, Joe Tis
j saw, Norma Norman and Harold Har
i per were there, sitting solemnly on
cushions. Miss M. Turner with a
demure smile of happy welcome ex
plained the costumes, pictures and
handiwork.
Aunt Jemina (Miss A. Cooper)
with a couple of black boys (Harris
Burke and E. Harper) took one into
the heart of Africa where an Afri
can hut, wild boars tusk and pictures
of Africa brought that dark contin
ent before one.
The negroes of America booth
where Rev. Mellon of the local negro
church and his little boy were sta
tioned, explained the work among onr
southern darkies.
THE COCONINO SUN
The city slums of America came j
next. Miss F. Shumway with Mar- J
ion Gaisser and Keith Richardson
dressed and acting the parts of pov
erty-stricken people, made one feel
the contrast between wealth and pov
erty, especially as their bed was one
of rags, gunny sacks, old carpet, a
duplicate of one seen in a Chicago
tenement home five doors from Chi
cago’s wealthiest street.
The Latin countries, Miss H. and
C. Burman, set forth the life among
the Spaniards of America. A serape
blanket and photos of South Ameri
ca told the story.
Medical missions were brought
home forcibly, for the booth Miss lva
Cox was nurse, Margaret Rudd as
assistants and Joan Softley as a pa
tient with a complexity of diseases,
made the great work of healing stand
out clearly.
Miss V. Sides and Helen Metz in
the next booth gave the visitor the
whole story of the bible in its his
; tory from Abraham to today, show
ing specimens of bibles in all lang
uages and of all ages, and types of
printing. Also the work of Sunday
schools was set forth. The alarming
fact that 27 million children in the
United States never receive any re
ligious training was stressed.
Next came “stewardship of all of
life for all life.” The average sal
arv of man is spent 70 per cent for
living, 15 per cent for culture, 14
per cent for non-essentials, one per
cent for God. Whereas it should be
60 per cent for living, 20 per cent for
! culture, 10 per cent for non-essen
tials, 10 per cent for God. Miss N.
Campbell and Jean Richardson thld
the story of this booth
Finally after such a bewildering
round of the world and the vastness
of the work of the church in all lands,
already loaded down with literature
describing the church work of every
country, the tourist came to the final
booth of missionary education, with
Miss J. Layton and Pauline Hedrick
in charge, and told how missions are
taught.
Upstairs to supper and then to
watch a series of sketches and a pa
geant. Those already named set
forth the contrast between the Mos
lem way of praying and our way.
Also the said life of the Hindoo wom
en, the longings of a mountain girl,
the ignorant cures sought by cripples,
the restriction of child life in the

slums, and the contrast between the
children going to Sunday school and
those not allowed to go by parents
who go autoriding Sundays.
The pageant set forth the history
of America in its wars, the gifts of
every nation to America and the cry
of every nation for help to America.
The Jew suggests Christ as the only
answer and America responds that
the Christ is the only answer for the
worlds ills, the church the means by
which Christ is given to the world
and missions the way the world is
served.
The wjhole exposition established
'conclusively the fact that the church
and its work in the whole world is
the greatest organized business force
in the world, larger than any com
mercial enterprise of international or
national scope..

ior and intermediate parts of the
school will be made this Sunday and

tional class rooms will be made. Par
ents are urged to send their children.
Rev. B. Wrenn Webb last Sunday
stated that this church is the only
Federated church in the entire country
keeping up its benevolences and strong
church life with any degree of suc
cess. His sermon was as fine as the
people have heard for months in the
church.

CORPORATION FORMED TO ]
DRILL FOR TEN MILLION
TON METEOR AT CRATER
(Continued from page 1)
some 400 feet in diameter, weighing
i in the neighborhood of 10,000,000 tons,
i It is referred to as the “Barringer
! meteorite.”
From a scientific standpoint the ex
ploration of Meteor Crater is intense
ly interesting. No meteorite of any
thing like the estimated size of the
Barringer meteorite has been found
anywhere on earth. The largest of
which there is any record weighed
only 37 tons. To determine the j
character of this visitor from the j
skies, according to Mr. Colvocoresses, I
would be a triumph of- scientific re- j
search and would add greatly to our,
knowledge of the origin and composi- j
tion of the bodies which form our solar
system.
As to the commercial aspect of the
exploration, practically all the iron
meteorites to which class the Canyon
Diablo meteorites belong, are com
posed of over 90 per cent iron and five
to eight per cent nickel, thus forming
a natural alloy similar to nickel steel.
The many Canyon Diablo meteors
also show an appreciable amount of
platinum and iridum.
“Aside from the assured scientific
value of the exploration,” say the
prospectus of the Meteor Crater Ex
ploration and Mining company, “the
expenditure of money on this project
must be necessarily a gamble. It is
possible, but extremely unlikely, that
the main body of the meteoric mass
may be of different composition from
the fragments found immediately sur
rounding the crater, or it may have
been altered in composition by leach
ing and the values so disseminated as
to make mining unprofitable. All sci
j entists agree that the size and value j
i of the meteoric mass cannot be known
i until actually located, measured and
| sampled, but it is probable that in the
! neighborhood of 10,000,000 tons of
meteoric iron will be found, largely in
j oxidized condition, with average re
covery of upwards of 90 per cent of
the values contained.”
The immediate plan of the company
: is to search for the main mass of the
Barringer meteorite by sinking a
| shaft and running drifts, aiming for a
| ppint below the bottom of the old drill
; hole, which is believed to have reached
the upper portions pf the meteoric
mass, and then to carry on other un
derground explorations to determine
the size and permit a reasonably thor
ough sampling of its different por
tions. The cost of the work has been
variously estimated at from $250,000
to $500,000.
No time has been set as to when
operations will start on the project,
| as the company is at present endeav
| oring to raise the necessary funds.

CHIEF JUSTICE BEATTY'S EXPLANATION
A T the request of Editor Charles McClatchy of the Sacramento
l\ Bee. Chief Justice Beatty has written for publication a
JL~\ letter in explanation'' 'of the supreme court decision in the
Schmitz case. The letter was* assuredly much needed, for
the confused, tangled and, in places, contradictory reasoning 'of the
opinion makes an authoritative translation necessary. Stripped of
preliminary matter, Judge Beatty's statement of tlie ground of
decision is that the indictment did not comply with the statutory
definition of the crime of extortion, because .it did not allege ""a
threat to do an injury, which, aside from and independent of its
evil motive, would be unlawful."" Further discussing the indict
ment the chief justice proceeds:
What it did allege on this point and all that it alleged was that one
E. E. Schmitz (without showing that he was mayor of the city; or that he
had any official or other influence over the board of police commissioners
greater than or different from that of the humblest private citizen) and that
Abraham Ruef (without showing that he had any such power or influence)
had told certain keepers of a restaurant that they could and had threatened
that they would prevent them from obtaining a* renewal of their license
to sell liquors, etc. The indictment, in other words, had no more force than;
if it had been directed against Jack Stiles and Richard Xoakes, for though
the facts that Schmitz was mayor and Ruef the political boss of the city
may have been as notorious in San Francisco as the fire and earthquake, no|
lawyer would contend for an instant that they were facts of which a court
could take judicial notice.
. This is just what The Call has contended from the beginning, !
that the decision turned on a close and narrow point of special
pleading. To say that the court can not take cognizance of a fact
of official record, such as the incumbency of a mayor, is to make
the law a foolish and impotent thing. The essential vice of this
method of attack is that it provides a plan"" by which any and every
• indictment or pleading may.be invalidated by reason of omission
to state matters of proof. Under that rule an indictment should
be as long as a lawyer's hypothetical question, and might run
20,000 words. The ruling is not unlike the other one by the same
court, which Judge Beatty tries to justify, where an indictment, was
set aside because it failed to state that the person killed was a human
being. It is this attachment to narrow construction that has been
the curse of California jurisprudence. We invite Judge Beatty to
contemplate Henry Ach and George D. Collins. Such men and their
methods are the natural and logical result of a narrow and technical'
jurisprudence. Such methods would .have short shrift in any other
commonwealth. * . !
EASTERN VIEW OF NEW SAN FRANCISCO
•w i THEN the new San Francisco is looked at from the other side
1/1/ of the continent.'says the New York Evening Post, ""it is the
V f * rorl spirit of the pioneer which gradually fills the eye."" The
metaphor may seem a little mixed, but it is kindly meant in
the way of appreciation for ""the sons of the argonauts,"" who still
keep a stout heart in the face of disaster. It is a review of progress
for twenty-four- months- of troubled life in San Francisco that our
• contemporary makes and finds t)iat ""the purely physical achieve-;
ments have been wholly admirable.""
Such is the general tone of the eastern brother looking on San
Francisco ""two years after."" They go down the line of big figures
for construction and puzzle out the pictures. It is not a tale. of woe
ordisaster that they hear, but one of confident outlook for the future.
The sidewalks are crowded, the streetcars overflowing and the popu
lation is back to its old figure. Touching the moral side of progress
and the host of troubles growing out of municipal corruption, the'
Post continues:
\u25a0 Recently the moral spirit of the city seemed to lag in its struggle with
grafters in high places. Motives of prosecutors. have been assailed and issues
befogged. There was grumbling in the clubs that ""interests"" were being
injured, that ""business"" would suffer. New York knows how powerfully
thiskind of undercurrent may be felt. Possibly the much delayed bringing
of ""Abe"" Ruef before a jury, which now seems imminent, despite the flood
of pamphlets and printed affidavits. which finds its way east, will clear the air
there and make plainer the target which' must be hit. At any rate, there
has been a fight, and the people in at least one election have stood pretty
solidly on the right side.
Yes, we are making some headway over rough ground. < If the
activity of the literary bureau of organized graft has extended to
eastern offices, the sister • commonwealths beyond the mountains
may form some idea of how much money, time and energy is spent i
a the immediate battlefield to obscure the issues and mislead the
public mind. With more than half the press of \u25a0 San Francisco ar
rayed on the, side. of corruption, the fight presents- some difficulty
with occasional varying fortunes, but, on the whole, we are making
substantial progress for the right. • ' V
THE CANDIDATE BUSINESS
. —
npHE democratic situation in New York lends itself naturally
R| to humor. Mr. Bryan is quite asj much embarrassed by his^
J_ friends as by his enemies in that state. When a peerless can
didate finds himself rejected with Jofty scorn by such as Boss-
Murphy of Tammany it is even more distressing to be thrown into
the arms of Pat McCarren of Brooklyn,. arid when ""Fingy"" Connors
of' Buffalo comes to condole the persecuted but persevering' can^
didate feels like flight to some vast wilderness where crooked poli-
ticians cease from troubling and even democrats are at rest The
humors of the situation appeal to the usually sbber sided New York
Tribune, viewing the embroilment close at hand. '\u25a0 It is'like this:
Mr. Murphy just ', now appears to I the McClcilan-Parker wing of
the democracy'and to be the* mainrneliance of the better element to save i the
party from Bryanism— so much i so, that: these; wbrthyj spirits/, who could. find
no ;.words too strong to 'denounce \u25a0 the ~ blackjack > used I in r : the ? interests -of
Hearst, are silent about the bloody pates ' left behind -by rthat-iristrumehtVem
ployed in behalf.: of j the^ best :tradiU6ns- of/, democracy.'j:i But-t hought Mr!

accept him as repular, for lust now he inclines to look with great respect
on possession of the machinery. NWill herecognize Mr. McCarrcn? , The
Brooklyn senator leading"" the Bryan cause , ? a gainst ''the embattled hosts of
the better clement uridcr Murphy 'would present a delightful political spec
tacle. Of .course he may choose neither of them, for th'etcrtium quid, Mr.
Hearst, may appeal to him as the rightful claimant.
What shall a thrifty candidate do when -confronted 1 with this
choice of evils? But; we await the outcome with the fullest con
fidence in Mr. Bryan's. agility., He is the only man that ever sue-;,
ceeded in making the candidate business pay. In thht capacity he
earns more than the salary paid to the man in. the White -House.
He wins if he Iqscs. To the .vanquished belong the spoils.

Need
Old Style Ballot Thing of Past, as Political
Parties and Clufes Demand Modern .Voting
Methods, Declares Former Registrar Walsh
Thomas J. Waish
IN making up the budget for the coming year, the finance committee of the
board of supervisori»had an almost universal demand for an appropriation
/of sufficient funds to equip.the election department with voting machmta •
to carry on the next election. At'present the .city has '52 on. hand- The
I demand comes from improvement clubs, and all those who desire to see the
I cityadopt this improved method of voting. In addition the representatives
of. all ""political parties in San Francisco appeared before the election com
mission last year and signified their desire to continue their use,"" but,j for
various reasons, they were not secured. . \u25a0••'"".
The result was that the city returned to paper ballots at the last election,
and to any one who had connection with election matters on that occasion
no better object lesson/could be afforded than the complete breakdown of the
old methods. Men were compelled to serve from 24 to 36 hours continuous
ly (that is those who did not succumb from exhaustion) in performing their
duties as election officers. In the majority of precincts, but two or three
remained out of the eight Officers originally appointed. Hundreds of- men
were drafted for the purpose of completing the count of the ballots; If
there ha<l been an organized effort to steal the election nothing would have
prevented it, as the representatives of the democratic party and. Good Gov
ernment league were worn out with their long vigil and had retired to *
their homes..
The system is brutal and the better and saner method should appeal to
all reasonable men. It is certain that hundreds of our citizens .who served
willingly at the last election in the interests of good government will qot
I sacrifice their health again.
\u25a0 While it is possible to find good citizens who still cling to the old methods.
in no place where the voting machine has had a fair trial would the voters
who are in favor of good government, return to paper ballots. In sixteen
states of this union machines are used, to .'wit:' New York, New Jersey, Con
j.necticut, Indiana, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin,
j Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Utah, Colorado, and 10 counties in Cali
] The major portion of the opposition to voting machines, according to
, the secretary of the state of New Jersey, as ""stated in his annual report for
i 1907, is from vote buyers, who can ""see the goods delivered on paper ballots,'
or"" who can manipulate the ballots after they are cast during the countmg by
bribing election officers."" As Secretary of State Curry aptly expressed it before
the election commission on April 20, 1907, ""the new method had the advantage
t of bringing it about that the election was over at 6 o'clock in the evening,
\u25a0 instead of commencing at that hour, as sometimes happened under the old
ballot system."" Xo businessman Questions the accuracy of the cash register, nor
does the banker doubt the correctness of the adding machine. Neither can
any person who is familiar with the voting machine doubt its registering the
j intent of the vofer. To those who have had the least experience with count-* .
j ing paper ballots it is needless to reined them of the rarity of ballots cor- ••
I rectly marked, and the many voters who vote for more, candidates for an
office than they arc entitled to under the law. This cannot occur on. the
voting machine. Even if the cost of elections was greater with machines
j than without, the many benefits derived would compensate the city, for their '
! purchase. But when the facts are that an election with machines costs the
municipality $25,000 to $30,000 less, it surely should appeal to every good
j citizen who believes in economy coupled with progress. The principal item •'
| of saving is\in the matter of election officers. With machines, allowing the"".
[ use of ,200, (ample for all purposes), the cost would be $9,000 for an election.
With paper ballots the cost Ms from $24,000 to $25,000. A clear saving of
$15,000. 'Other .items such as extra booths, paper, etc, would easily cost
$10,000 to $15,000 more with paper ballots than with machines. BmBwH
. . Another objection to the machine, made by some well meaning citizens,
is :that,it, hampers selection and encourages straight party voting. That this
VS not well founded can be proved by the fact that in the election of 1906
certain candidates' for judges who were on the republican,' democratic and
union labor tickets received but 16,000 votes, whereas a candidate for the
same office on the democratic. Independence league and nonpartisan ticket •
received 21,000 votes, clearly demonstrating that the voter, after having used
the -.machine at but one previous election, had learned to manipulate, the
'keys, intelligently.. '. \
• That the opportunity for fraud with paper ballots is ever pres«nt is
proved by i the' contest for sheriff _ in. the county of Santa Clara. in 1907, when,
on a recount of votes, the trial judge declared that he was satisfied that
hundreds of ballots were changed after they had been deposited in the cus
tody of the county clerk. With voting machines election contests are elimin
ated, and any person who has lived in San Francisco for any number of*
years can recall the numerous occasions on which fraud was shown on re
counts of paper ballots.
The city, of Buffalo has a population about equal to tha.t of San Francisco,
and the verdict of the city officials after 10 years' trial is set forth in the
following letter: -

Thos. J. Walsh Esq.. 928 Halght st., San Francisco. CaL "" S§3
Dear Sir:— I am In receipt by reference from his bonor, the mayor, of your
letter asking about the use of voting machines In the city of Buffalo. *
Voting machines have been In use In the city of Buffalo about 10 yeaYs
The results are entirely satisfactory, and I do not hesitate to say that any
proposition to remove them and return to the old ballot system would meet
.with unanimous opposition from our citlsens. By means of these machines
we are able to have jmuch larger election. districts, thus reducing very mate
rially the \ expenses of elections. .The manner and method of voting both
straight and spilt tickets has been mastered by. all classes of voters; there ara
no after disputes as to the exact meaning of marks on ballots such as wars
constantly occurring under. the old regime: the record is ready for announce
ment to the public immediately after the last veter has recorded his vote and
when I state that our polls close at 5 o'clock p. m. and that newspapers are
selling on the streets before 7 p. m. with the full returns you can readily ao
preclate how our system is permeated with rr|»dern rapid transit Ideas I do
not hesitate to affirm that any community which once gives a properly con
structed voting machine a trial will not willingly return to paper ballots. Youra

EDINBURG. July 3-With Sgt.
fixpeinskl hurling three-hit ball and
1 striking out IS. the Brownsville en
try In the Valley-Wide Playground
Ball Tournament eliminated the
Harlingen All-Stan 6-1 in a lively
contest here Tuesday night.
Sgt. Scpeinskl, who twirled the
Port Brown Yankees to a first-half
pennant In the Brownsville league,
was In excellent form and he got
errorless support from the team
1 refolded together by Manager Sam
Lesser.
No two of the three Harlingen
blngles came In the same Inning,
and only one of them was for extra
bases—a two-ply clout to short
center by W. Anderson in the Ini
tial stanza.
The Hubcity twlrlers. Williams
and Nowlin, pitched creditable ball
but they could do little In the face
of nine errors by their teammates.
These errors, coupled with timely
hits and heads-up ball on the part
of the Brownsville agggregatlon al
lowed runs to trickle across in the
second, third, fourth and seventh
I Innings.
' Harlingen threatened In the open
ing stanza when W. Anderson, the
first batter doubled sharply to short -
4 center. The threat was ended when
fegt. Sxpeinski bore down and whiff
ed the next three batters in order.
Drake, Davis and Garrison It was too
bad then, for the ""Old Sarge"" had
, his dander up and that was the last
Harlingen batter to get on until he
walked Snaveley with two down In
the sixth. Again a strikeout wiped
cut the threat with Williams being
the victim.
In the seventh W. Anderson sin
gled again, this time to center, and
took second and third on passed
balls. Sgt. “Ski"" arose to the occas
ion again by striking out Drake and
Davis and making Garrison trickle
out second to first.
; Snaveley made the lone Harlingen
tally In the ninth. First man up. he
4 got a ducat to first. Nowlin whiffed.
V Anderson walked, Drake lcfted out
to second and Davis singled to cen
ter with Snaveley going home. The
game ended with Garrison flying out
to second.
I Brownsville broke the scoring Ice
[ In the third stanza when two walks.
I errors at pitch, first and third and
general loose play allowed the visi
tors to chase two runs across the
platter. Martin and Jeanes scored.
Lesser scored in the third after
singling past short, taking second on
a passed ball and scoring on WU
f Hams' error. The visitors completely
' iced the game away in the fifth with
two more tallies by Norwood and
'< Escobar. Singles by Escobar and
lesser, several errors and a passed
ball accounted for the tallies.
Jeanes made the final Brownsville
taUy in the seventh when he got on
through a walk, stole second and
went horn* on Escobar’s single to
right.
""Lofo"" Escobar. Sam Lesser and
Fred Trdla wen* the big hitters for
the winners, each getting a brace of
safeties. W. Anderson was the big
gun for Harlingen, getting a double
and a single in three servings at
the platter. He got an another time
through a walk In the ninth.
Brownsville will play its second
game in the tournament next Tues
day when it takes on McAllen, win

mound for the Indians and were rap
ped for 10 hits.
San Antmio hit In the pinches to

of Burt Hlnkley and Trav Jennings
ior the part they played to the
Kiwanis victory over the Goodyears
Monday night to the deciding game

“They should call Hlnkley Iron
Man',"" Perl says. ""Why he drove all
the way from Houston, arriving
just before the game. And what did
do? Why he hit a home run to
the fourth with the bags loaded!
Suppose he had not driven from

hit several home runs.
“And don’t forget that Jennings
man. He handled three chances on

THE KIWANI9 club is m ski if a
final drive in an effort to sell the
remainder of the $10 bonds to be
used In erecting a night football
plant on Tucker Field, Approxim
ately 135 of the bonds have been
sold so far. but it is hoped to sell
at least 210 of them before the
sale is closed out
The bonds mature in five years
and pay no interest. The bona
issue is purely a civic move to give
the Brownsville high boys a plan*
cn a par with those used by other
South Texas cities.
Sixty percent of the net gats
receipts on Tucker Field will be set(
aside to retire the bonds, and It is
believed certain that the bona
issue will retire itself within three
years. The funds will be distributed
to the stockholders each time $500
is collected In the fund.
If the Klwanls salesmen have
not contacted you, get In toucn
with Otto Manske. Robin Pate or
ary other Kiwani&n and they will
will supply you with a bond.
This is one of your few chances
to materially help the youngsters
who play the grid game, and con
struction of the plant certainly will
be a big boost to football Interest
here. The game Is on the comeback
trail here, and the Eagles should
have a fine club this season. You’ll
never miss the $10. and you will
ftt It back within three years. Give
the grid game a boost with a $16
loan.

Dope Indicates Yankees To
Meet Giants In Big
Series
(By The Associated Pram)
The World Series battle lines are
forming, and the experts predict a
civil strife.
July 4th has a deep significance
to the dopesters who chart the
trends of big league clubs and tell
you whither they are going.
By Independence Day the season
is about half over, and the teams
have settled down to their natural
strides. The best teams usually
have started their surge to the
fore
With this axiom in mind, the ex
perts predict that the World 8erles
will be an all-New York affair.
The Olants. with a healthy lead
over the rest of the National
League teams, have shown both
the offensive and defensive strength
to pull out an asy winner.
In the American League, the ex
perts hand the gonfalon to the
Yankees, although they are not so
positive about it as they are with
the Olants. Gomez has not shown
the box effectiveness of other years,
and Lou Gehrig Is finding it hard
to meet the ball with his old reg
ularity.
Dodgers Doing Well
Then there Is that little matter
of the Detroit Tigers dogging
along, paced by the belting Hank
Greenberg and a good pitching
staff.
Roy Parmalee. a faltering mem
ber of the Giants pitching staff,
went the route Tuesday as the
leaders defeated the Phillies 8 to
4. It was the ninth victory for
Parmalee. who had failed in his
three previous starts.
The Brooklyn Dodgers got in the
victory column at the expense of
Boston. 5 to 0. The Cardinals
climbed back into third place In
the National League by blanking
Pittsburgh. 7-0. with Wild Bill Hal
lahan pitching his first complete
victory of the season.
Chicago defeated Cincinnati. 9-3.
In the American League the
Yankees conquered Philadelphia*
coming from behind to win 8-8*
Boston put on a five-run rally in
the seventh to beat Washington 8-5.
and Detroit stepped over Cleveland
Into second place by defeating the

try In the Valley-Wide Playground
Ball Tournament eliminated the
Harlingen All-Stan 6-1 in a lively
contest here Tuesday night.
Sgt. Scpeinskl, who twirled the
Port Brown Yankees to a first-half
pennant In the Brownsville league,
was In excellent form and he got
errorless support from the team
1 refolded together by Manager Sam
Lesser.
No two of the three Harlingen
blngles came In the same Inning,
and only one of them was for extra
bases—a two-ply clout to short
center by W. Anderson in the Ini
tial stanza.
The Hubcity twlrlers. Williams
and Nowlin, pitched creditable ball
but they could do little In the face
of nine errors by their teammates.
These errors, coupled with timely
hits and heads-up ball on the part
of the Brownsville agggregatlon al
lowed runs to trickle across in the
second, third, fourth and seventh
I Innings.
' Harlingen threatened In the open
ing stanza when W. Anderson, the
first batter doubled sharply to short -
4 center. The threat was ended when
fegt. Sxpeinski bore down and whiff
ed the next three batters in order.
Drake, Davis and Garrison It was too
bad then, for the ""Old Sarge"" had
, his dander up and that was the last
Harlingen batter to get on until he
walked Snaveley with two down In
the sixth. Again a strikeout wiped
cut the threat with Williams being
the victim.
In the seventh W. Anderson sin
gled again, this time to center, and
took second and third on passed
balls. Sgt. “Ski"" arose to the occas
ion again by striking out Drake and
Davis and making Garrison trickle
out second to first.
; Snaveley made the lone Harlingen
tally In the ninth. First man up. he
4 got a ducat to first. Nowlin whiffed.
V Anderson walked, Drake lcfted out
to second and Davis singled to cen
ter with Snaveley going home. The
game ended with Garrison flying out
to second.
I Brownsville broke the scoring Ice
[ In the third stanza when two walks.
I errors at pitch, first and third and
general loose play allowed the visi
tors to chase two runs across the
platter. Martin and Jeanes scored.
Lesser scored in the third after
singling past short, taking second on
a passed ball and scoring on WU
f Hams' error. The visitors completely
' iced the game away in the fifth with
two more tallies by Norwood and
'< Escobar. Singles by Escobar and
lesser, several errors and a passed
ball accounted for the tallies.
Jeanes made the final Brownsville
taUy in the seventh when he got on
through a walk, stole second and
went horn* on Escobar’s single to
right.
""Lofo"" Escobar. Sam Lesser and
Fred Trdla wen* the big hitters for
the winners, each getting a brace of
safeties. W. Anderson was the big

“They should call Hlnkley Iron

the way from Houston, arriving
just before the game. And what did
do? Why he hit a home run to
the fourth with the bags loaded!
Suppose he had not driven from

hit several home runs.
“And don’t forget that Jennings
man. He handled three chances on

THE KIWANI9 club is m ski if a
final drive in an effort to sell the
remainder of the $10 bonds to be
used In erecting a night football
plant on Tucker Field, Approxim
ately 135 of the bonds have been
sold so far. but it is hoped to sell
at least 210 of them before the
sale is closed out
The bonds mature in five years
and pay no interest. The bona
issue is purely a civic move to give
the Brownsville high boys a plan*
cn a par with those used by other
South Texas cities.
Sixty percent of the net gats
receipts on Tucker Field will be set(
aside to retire the bonds, and It is
believed certain that the bona
issue will retire itself within three
years. The funds will be distributed
to the stockholders each time $500
is collected In the fund.
If the Klwanls salesmen have
not contacted you, get In toucn
with Otto Manske. Robin Pate or
ary other Kiwani&n and they will
will supply you with a bond.
This is one of your few chances
to materially help the youngsters
who play the grid game, and con
struction of the plant certainly will
be a big boost to football Interest
here. The game Is on the comeback
trail here, and the Eagles should
have a fine club this season. You’ll
never miss the $10. and you will
ftt It back within three years. Give
the grid game a boost with a $16
loan.

N. Y. IS SEWING
UP BALL WORLD
Dope Indicates Yankees To
Meet Giants In Big
Series
(By The Associated Pram)
The World Series battle lines are
forming, and the experts predict a
civil strife.
July 4th has a deep significance
to the dopesters who chart the
trends of big league clubs and tell
you whither they are going.
By Independence Day the season
is about half over, and the teams
have settled down to their natural
strides. The best teams usually
have started their surge to the
fore
With this axiom in mind, the ex
perts predict that the World 8erles
will be an all-New York affair.
The Olants. with a healthy lead
over the rest of the National
League teams, have shown both
the offensive and defensive strength
to pull out an asy winner.
In the American League, the ex
perts hand the gonfalon to the
Yankees, although they are not so
positive about it as they are with
the Olants. Gomez has not shown
the box effectiveness of other years,
and Lou Gehrig Is finding it hard
to meet the ball with his old reg
ularity.
Dodgers Doing Well
Then there Is that little matter
of the Detroit Tigers dogging
along, paced by the belting Hank
Greenberg and a good pitching
staff.
Roy Parmalee. a faltering mem
ber of the Giants pitching staff,
went the route Tuesday as the
leaders defeated the Phillies 8 to
4. It was the ninth victory for
Parmalee. who had failed in his
three previous starts.
The Brooklyn Dodgers got in the
victory column at the expense of
Boston. 5 to 0. The Cardinals
climbed back into third place In
the National League by blanking
Pittsburgh. 7-0. with Wild Bill Hal
lahan pitching his first complete
victory of the season.
Chicago defeated Cincinnati. 9-3.
In the American League the
Yankees conquered Philadelphia*
coming from behind to win 8-8*
Boston put on a five-run rally in
the seventh to beat Washington 8-5.
and Detroit stepped over Cleveland
Into second place by defeating the
Indiana 8-3. -

try In the Valley-Wide Playground
Ball Tournament eliminated the
Harlingen All-Stan 6-1 in a lively
contest here Tuesday night.
Sgt. Scpeinskl, who twirled the
Port Brown Yankees to a first-half
pennant In the Brownsville league,
was In excellent form and he got
errorless support from the team
1 refolded together by Manager Sam
Lesser.
No two of the three Harlingen
blngles came In the same Inning,
and only one of them was for extra
bases—a two-ply clout to short
center by W. Anderson in the Ini
tial stanza.
The Hubcity twlrlers. Williams
and Nowlin, pitched creditable ball
but they could do little In the face
of nine errors by their teammates.
These errors, coupled with timely
hits and heads-up ball on the part
of the Brownsville agggregatlon al
lowed runs to trickle across in the
second, third, fourth and seventh
I Innings.
' Harlingen threatened In the open
ing stanza when W. Anderson, the
first batter doubled sharply to short -
4 center. The threat was ended when
fegt. Sxpeinski bore down and whiff
ed the next three batters in order.
Drake, Davis and Garrison It was too
bad then, for the ""Old Sarge"" had
, his dander up and that was the last
Harlingen batter to get on until he
walked Snaveley with two down In
the sixth. Again a strikeout wiped
cut the threat with Williams being
the victim.
In the seventh W. Anderson sin
gled again, this time to center, and
took second and third on passed
balls. Sgt. “Ski"" arose to the occas
ion again by striking out Drake and
Davis and making Garrison trickle
out second to first.
; Snaveley made the lone Harlingen
tally In the ninth. First man up. he
4 got a ducat to first. Nowlin whiffed.
V Anderson walked, Drake lcfted out
to second and Davis singled to cen
ter with Snaveley going home. The
game ended with Garrison flying out
to second.
I Brownsville broke the scoring Ice
[ In the third stanza when two walks.
I errors at pitch, first and third and
general loose play allowed the visi
tors to chase two runs across the
platter. Martin and Jeanes scored.
Lesser scored in the third after
singling past short, taking second on
a passed ball and scoring on WU
f Hams' error. The visitors completely
' iced the game away in the fifth with
two more tallies by Norwood and
'< Escobar. Singles by Escobar and
lesser, several errors and a passed
ball accounted for the tallies.
Jeanes made the final Brownsville
taUy in the seventh when he got on
through a walk, stole second and
went horn* on Escobar’s single to
right.
""Lofo"" Escobar. Sam Lesser and
Fred Trdla wen* the big hitters for
the winners, each getting a brace of
safeties. W. Anderson was the big
gun for Harlingen, getting a double
and a single in three servings at
the platter. He got an another time
through a walk In the ninth.

SAM PERL Is loud to his praise
of Burt Hlnkley and Trav Jennings
ior the part they played to the
Kiwanis victory over the Goodyears
Monday night to the deciding game
of the second-half playoff series to
the Brownsville Playground Ball
league.
“They should call Hlnkley Iron
Man',"" Perl says. ""Why he drove all
the way from Houston, arriving
just before the game. And what did
do? Why he hit a home run to
the fourth with the bags loaded!
Suppose he had not driven from
Houston? He probably would have
hit several home runs.
“And don’t forget that Jennings
man. He handled three chances on
second nicely, and whanged out a
hit in the fourth.**

THE KIWANI9 club is m ski if a
final drive in an effort to sell the
remainder of the $10 bonds to be
used In erecting a night football
plant on Tucker Field, Approxim
ately 135 of the bonds have been
sold so far. but it is hoped to sell
at least 210 of them before the
sale is closed out
The bonds mature in five years
and pay no interest. The bona
issue is purely a civic move to give
the Brownsville high boys a plan*
cn a par with those used by other
South Texas cities.
Sixty percent of the net gats
receipts on Tucker Field will be set(
aside to retire the bonds, and It is
believed certain that the bona
issue will retire itself within three
years. The funds will be distributed
to the stockholders each time $500
is collected In the fund.
If the Klwanls salesmen have
not contacted you, get In toucn
with Otto Manske. Robin Pate or
ary other Kiwani&n and they will
will supply you with a bond.
This is one of your few chances
to materially help the youngsters
who play the grid game, and con
struction of the plant certainly will
be a big boost to football Interest
here. The game Is on the comeback
trail here, and the Eagles should
have a fine club this season. You’ll
never miss the $10. and you will
ftt It back within three years. Give
the grid game a boost with a $16
loan.

N. Y. IS SEWING
UP BALL WORLD
Dope Indicates Yankees To
Meet Giants In Big
Series
(By The Associated Pram)
The World Series battle lines are
forming, and the experts predict a
civil strife.
July 4th has a deep significance
to the dopesters who chart the
trends of big league clubs and tell
you whither they are going.
By Independence Day the season
is about half over, and the teams
have settled down to their natural
strides. The best teams usually
have started their surge to the
fore
With this axiom in mind, the ex
perts predict that the World 8erles
will be an all-New York affair.
The Olants. with a healthy lead
over the rest of the National
League teams, have shown both
the offensive and defensive strength
to pull out an asy winner.
In the American League, the ex
perts hand the gonfalon to the
Yankees, although they are not so
positive about it as they are with
the Olants. Gomez has not shown
the box effectiveness of other years,
and Lou Gehrig Is finding it hard
to meet the ball with his old reg
ularity.
Dodgers Doing Well
Then there Is that little matter
of the Detroit Tigers dogging
along, paced by the belting Hank
Greenberg and a good pitching
staff.
Roy Parmalee. a faltering mem
ber of the Giants pitching staff,
went the route Tuesday as the
leaders defeated the Phillies 8 to
4. It was the ninth victory for
Parmalee. who had failed in his
three previous starts.
The Brooklyn Dodgers got in the
victory column at the expense of
Boston. 5 to 0. The Cardinals
climbed back into third place In
the National League by blanking
Pittsburgh. 7-0. with Wild Bill Hal
lahan pitching his first complete
victory of the season.
Chicago defeated Cincinnati. 9-3.
In the American League the
Yankees conquered Philadelphia*
coming from behind to win 8-8*
Boston put on a five-run rally in
the seventh to beat Washington 8-5.
and Detroit stepped over Cleveland
Into second place by defeating the
Indiana 8-3. -

Stratton took the first with a too

ing leg scissor on Stratton during
most of the third fall, and It waa
a big surprise when Stratton cam*
ou of it to clamp on the winning
