Wonder of
the World ,Z
THE ancient Greeks catalogued the
“Seven Wonders of the World”
and it has remained for modern
science to now add an “eight wonder” —
the greatest wonder of them all.
Countless ages ago a gigantic celestial
visitor, bigger than fifty Woolworth build
ings, shot through the sky and shocked
and punctured the peaceful surface of the,
earth—a monster meteor of iron, liberally
mixed with diamonds and precious metals
of priceless value. This monster has now
been found.
For more than a dozen years digging
for it has been going on. The attempt
was abandoned, resumed, again given up
as hopeless.
All of this very quietly; advertisement
of the enterprise was not desired. Now,
at length, it has suc-
ceeded, ami of that
success this is the
first announcement.
Think of a meteor
—a “fallen star”—
more than five hun
dred feet in di
ameter and weighing
twelve million tons!
Was there ever the
like? Not so far as
known, certainly, or
anything in the least
comparable to it.
There are other
things to be said
about it, equally re
markable, as will
presently be seen.
It fell a long time
-—at least many
thousands of years—
ago, near the Canon
Diablo, in Arizona. A lot of stories have
been printed about it, speculatively; for,
in striking the earth, it made a hole two
thirds of a mile in diameter and nearly
circular. The hole, four hundred feet deep,
was originally supposed to be a .volcanic
crater. But geologists declared that noth
ing imaginable could account for it except
the impact of a gigantic meteor, which
must be buried,— a huge mass of iron—
deep in the ground.
If the meteor was Jhere it could pre
sumably be reached by digging. Such an
enormous mass of metal would be worth
a lot of money, leaving out of considera
tion the scientific interest.
So digging was undertaken on an im
portant scale, shafts being sunk, supple
mented by drilling to a depth of nearly a
thousand feet. Nothing came of it.
Indeed, as is now known, the drilling
might have been carried to unlimited
depths without striking the buried meteor.
It was not there.
If not there, where was it? The an
swer, as now known, was that it was out
side the cup of the “crater,” beneath its
eastern rim. Why, will be explained later.
It was finally reached by driving an
inclined tunnel from some distance out
side the east rim, westward and down
ward at an angle of forty-five degrees.
The tunnel, a thousand feet long, came
upon the giant meteor at a depth of about
fiv hundred feet. Kight there the work
men’s picks struck an impenetrable ob
stacle.
Now the problem is to get at the mass
and remove it, necessarily in many pieces.
To lift it out entire is impossible. To get
it out at all is a difficult engineering
operation, but, now that its location is ex
actly known the task reduces itself to
mere terms of labor and cost. Already
work has been begun on a deep open cut.
One reason for the difficulty lies in the
Mining Engineers Missed the Most Startling
Mineral Discovery Ever Known Because They
Neglected to Calculate That the Meteor Plunging
Down from the West Would Be Found East of the
Crater. An Angled Tunnel Has Solved
the Mystery.
fact that meteoric iron is one of the hard
est substances known, containing a con
siderable percentage of nickel ordinarily.
It is, in effect, nickel-steel, and its com
position is said to have given the first
hint for the use of such an alloy in the
manufacture of armor for battleships.
It is going to be a big job, therefore,
to break the mass into removable frag
ments. This is likely to be accomplished
by sawing, rather than by high explosives.
But in the meantime the meteor must be
exposed to view and rendered accessible
by mining.
How, it may be asked, can the job pay,
taking the difficulties into vi w? An
equivalent quantity of iron could surely
be obtained elsewhere much more cheaply.
Ah! There lies the most important
point of the story. It is known with cer
tainty that the meteor contains three
fourths of an ounce of platinum to the
ton. How this is known will presently be
explained.
Do you know how much platinum is
worth to-day? . One hundred and fifteen
dollars an ounce! The weight of the mass
underground is estimated at twelve mil
lion tons. It should, then, contain nine
million ounces of platinum, which, at the
price above mentioned, would have a mar
ket value of more than a billion dollars.
Platinum, weight for weight, has nearly
six times the value of gold. It is an ex
tremely scarce metal, indispensable for
many purposes. We have almost none of
it in this country, nearly all of the world's
supply coming from the Urals in Russia
and from Colombia, South America.
But here, apparently, is a billion dol
lars’ worth of this precious white metal,
dropped upon our territory out of the sky.
A miracle, truly. In respect to platinum,
we shall be lifted suddenly from barest
poverty to almost incredible affluence.

artillerists not long ago proved that a pro
jectile, striking a mass of rock such as a
cliff, produces an “impact crater” seven
times the diameter of the projectile. The
meteor was, in effect, a projectile, and,
applying this rule, it must have been about
five hundred and fifty feet in diameter
in order to produce the crater here de
scribed in Arizona.
That crater (so to call it) is a most
tremendous dent in the rocky crust of the
earth. Its cup, across the top, measures
thirty-seven hundred feet one way and
thirty-eight hundred feet another way, the
two lines of measurement being at right
angles. The rim, composed of material
forced up by the impact of the meteor in
striking, is a ring-shaped hill two hundred
feet high.
Those figures are needed to give a no
tion of the mightiness of the celestial pro
jectile that hit Arizona in the long ago.
traveling at a speed fifty times that of a
rifle bullet, its impact must have caused
the whole earth to tremble, and doubtless
all Arizona was illuminated for a few
minutes by an uprush of flaming gas.

The huge projectile entered our atmos

of ice would be hot, comparatively speak
ing. The temperature was the absolute
zero of outer space, 371 degrees below
the zero of the Fahrenheit thermometer.
But, passing through the atmosphere with
such incredible swiftness, it was set on
fire by friction, the outer part of it being
melted and, to some extent, vaporized
The giant meteor struck Arizona slant
wise, coming from the west. If it had
descended vertically it would have been
found by digging inside the cup of the
crater. But, coming down at an angle, it
lodged deep down beneath the rim of the
crater, on the east side. The easiest way
to reach it was by starting an inclined tun
nel from some distance outside the rim
on that side, driving it downward and
toward the rim as already described.
Hundreds of fragments, melted and
broken off from the meteor, have been
found in the near neighborhood of the
crater. Their character is unmistakable,
inasmuch as meteoric iron is in structure
and composition unlike anything else in

the world. One of them weighed over a
thousand pounds. All of them were found
on the west side of the crater; none at the
east side. This was good evidence that
the meteor came down with a slant from
the west and toward the east.
In some of the fragments diamonds
were found, colorless, yellowish, blue, and
black. Most interesting. It is supposed
that they were crystallized out by high
heat from carbon in the nu teor. They
were too small to have any commercial
value, but Dr. George F. Kunz, the
famous gem expert, obtained half a
carat’s weight of them by dissolving a
considerable quantity of the iron. Many

croscopic examination exploded and dis
appeared. Big diamonds, taken front
mines, sometimes do the same thing.
Formed by volcanic agency, they may en
close cavities filled with gas at v< ry high
pressure, and so fly to pieci s.
The notion originally entertained, that
the hole in Canon Diablo wa> a volcanic
crater having long ago been dismissed,
geologists were led to speculate regarding
its origin. Prof. Grove K. Gilbert, of tie
U. S. Geological Survey, was first to call
attention to its likeness to the so-called
craters of the moon, which latter, he be
lieved. were scars made by the impact of
“moonlets” that formerly traveled around
the earth in flocks, eventually to be swal
lowed up by the lunar orb.
If so, why might not a giant meteor —
call it a mooniet if you choose—strike
the earth and make just such a crater’
Further study convinced geologists that,
whether Prof. Gilbert’s theory about the
moon was correct or net. the Arizona
crater was almost certainly to be attrib
uted to the impact of a. celestial body.
One of them. Dr. Daniel Moreau Bar
ringer, who was a man of means, backed
the idea with money, and undertook to
sink shafts in the big hole.
He found the surface rocks, limestone
and sandstone thoroughly shattered to a
depth of three hundred feet, as if by a

composing the sandstone were fused as

the rocky stuff to mush and bringing up
samples of it. The
thinking on the problem and proceeded
once more to tackle the job.
He has found the meteor. Doubtless a
lot will soon he printed about it in the
newspapers, but this is the first announce
ment. There will be plenty to be said
when the mass is exposed to view and the
wealth it represents has been rendered
available.
Obviously, this meteor, if only by rea
son of its enormous size, reduces the
largest ones hitherto found to an im
portance r< latively trifling. The biggest
heretofore known is the famous Peary
meteorite, found by the Arctic explorer
at Cape York, in Greenland, weighing
thirty-six and a half tons. That meteorite
may be seen today at the Museum of
Natural History in New York.
The next largest meteorite is now in the
city of Mexico. It is shaped like a ham
and weighs about twenty-five tons. It
was found in 1900 by the late Prof.
Henry A. Ward. Mexico.
The third largest meteorite, and the
biggest <>ne ever found in the United
States, is the “Willamette,” now owned
by the Museum of Natural History’ in
New York. It is ten feet long, six and a
half feet high, and four feet three inches
thick, weighing 31,107 pounds.
The finding of platinum in a meteor
altogether new. From a merely scientific
viewpoint, therefore, the presence of that
rare and precious metal in the Arizona
“fallen star” is of utmost interest. Add
to that the diamonds it contains possibly
there may be some big ones in the me
tallic mass—and you have something
worth getting excited about.
Think of a mass of meteoric iron five
hundred and fifty feet in diameter! Con
sider the platinum it contains the most
precious of all metals. A billion dollars'
worth!
A worthwhile “star” indeed. Although
a small one, rich. How wonderful that
such a mass of wealth should be sent to
us by an accidental shot out of the void
of cosmic space.

agree whether the bottomless bores tn
which they are found and which are
known as ""diamo id pipes"" are the
result of ancient volcanic action ex
plosions of subterranean laboratories
which are nature's diaxionc' factories,
or of meteors which are themselves
the crucibles from celestial regions In
which the diamonds are produced.
The latter theory has many dis
tinguished supporters, of whom the
most eminent ,perhaps, is Sir Will
iam Crookes, the great English sci
entist. Sir William examined one of
the fragments of the great Arizona
meteor and found it to contain dia
mond crystals. Speaking of the
""pipes"" in which diamonds are
fouud at Kimberley, Sir WUliam
said ;
""They are Irregularly shaped
round or oval pipes extending ver
tically downward to unknown depths,
retaining about the same diameter
throughout.
""How these great pipes were orig
inally formed it Is hard to say. They
were certainly not burst through in
the ordinary manner of volcanic
eruption, since the surrounding and
enclosing walls show no signs of
igneous action.""
It Is well known that meteors are
ln au Incandescent state when they
reach the surface of the earth,
brought to white heat by friction
with our atmosphere. It has been
suggested that the meteor thus he
comes a crucible which furnishes
both the intense heat and the tre
mendous pressure necessary to
liquify and then lo crystallize car
bon. Scientifically, therefore, there Is
every reason to believe that the Ari
zona meteor is well worth the years
of effort and the hundreds of thou
sands of dollars that have been spent
ln trying to locate it; the only ques
tion being whether it is imbedded so
deeply that all human efforts to dis
lodge it will prove fruitless.

has been the subject of Indian tra
dition The Mokta have a tradition of -blazing

when Old Mnn Coyote was a talking
animal and when the oldest of the
abandoned cliff houses in the South
west was new. The legend tells how
the Mokls had offended the G-reat
Spirit, and finally a warning was
bent ln the shape of a blazing star
which lighted up the earth for him
dreds of miles around and whose
shock was so terrific that several
Mokl villages were all but ruined.
The Mokls heeded the warning, and
since the falling of the blazing star
they bavo so walked in the paths
of rectitude that they are among the
favored peoples of Manltom
Aside from mere curiosity and
speculation, the i-pot where the great
meteor fel was of little interest to
humanity until a wandering sheep
herder, who had been grazing his
flocks In the vicinity of Meteorite
Mountain, picked up a fragment of
meteorite which, besides meteoric
iron, proved to contain hard, black
diamonds of great value for mechan
ic;!; purposes.
The earth In the vicinity of Mete
orite Mountain la etrewn with frag
mentS, evidently loosened f'-otn the
main body by the terrific Impact as
the heavenly messenger struck the
earth. The herder picked up a larc
fragment and
was about to
toss it aside
when its great
weight appealed
to him as some
thing peculiar.
Ho took It to
camp and turn
ed it over to a
collector, who In
turn took it to
an eminent Eng
lish scientist.
Search was
made for more
fragments of
meteorite in the
vicinity of Me

in the hope that
other discover

would result.

News of the discovery on Meteor
Mountain soon leaked out. in spite of
strenuous efforts to keep it quler,

There are about forty acres in the
bottom of this so-called crater. On
all tides a sloping wall rises to a
height of from rive to six hundred
feet The wall is sandy, and climb
ing to the top is difficult. The bot
tom of the depression Is covered with
huge rocks, some of which weigh
many tons, and which are evidoutly
portions of rock strata displaced bj
the falling meteorlte.
The nearest settlement is at Volz's
trading post, a few miles from 'th
mountain, in the heart of the desert.
Mr. Volz, the trader at Canyon Dlab
olo, has lived ln tbe vicinity of
Meteor Mountain for years, and has
been interested in the work of min
ing for the meteorite. All the set
tlers In that part of tbe Southwest
believe that the main body of the
meteorite will be discovered at some
not distant day, and that science will
be immeasurably enriched, even if
the investigators do not find as
large a proportion of valuable car

things brought back by Commander
Peary from his last trip of polar
discovery was a large meteorite,
which was sold for several thou
sand dollars. Fragments of varying
size aud weight are picked up from
tim-2 to time, it being a theory gen
erally accepted that the averaga
meteorite bursts when it strikes the
belt of dense, atmoephero surround
ing the earth. Generally this burst
ing is so thorough Lhat tht meteorite
la scattered into durt, and bifts to
earth in that iorm. Only occasion
ally do larger fragments survive.
In the case of the Arizona meteor
ite, however, it would ceem that the
falling body was so large that the
usual process ot disintegration did
not take place when the dense at
Biosphere of earth was struck. The
giant meteorite kept on falling Ln a
solid, blazing mass, until it was ex
tinguished in tho sands of the des

face of the earth.
The largest showers of meteors
occur in August and November, and
exhibit their greatest brilliancy
every thirty-three years. Most of
these recorded showers are of the
smaller variety of meteorites. Noth

STATES CLOSING THEIR
FIRST DECADE IN
REAL ROAD BUILDING
WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. 5.
—Forty-eight states, in conjunc
tion with the Bureau of Public
Roads; Department of Agriculture,
ate round ng oot their first de
cadt of modern road building with
gratifying resolts, according to a
statement issued by the American
Association of State Highway Of-j
ficials. The intersate system,
however, on which state and Fed
eral governments have been work
ing jointly, is rjqt more than half
complete, and suggestions of cur
tailment of the general program
for the purpose of economy have
served to arouse public interest
in pusing on toward completion of
the remaining half.
In some quarters the question
of constitutionality of the present
Federal * Aid road program has
again been raised, which highway
officials hold is irrelevant in view
of the exhaustive * studies that
were made before the program was
put into effect.
In response to points raised,
.highway officials in their state
ment call public attention to the
fact that “there were those in the
beginning of our national life who
had visions of interstate highways
as nation developers, for as early
as 1803 the Cumberland Pike
planned by Congress. Jefferson.
Hamilton. Madison, Clay, (j|U
houn, and Webster all maintained
a constitutional authority, as well
as the national need, for Federal
activities in highway improve
ments. •
“But a short time after the
construction of the Cumberland
Pike it was turned over to the
states, which likewise became
weary and in turn passed it on to
toll companies. An then for half
a century the much wanted"" local
control” was given a most excel
lent “try-out”. The result if all
of which was that the only free
public highways for years were
those which were impassable’ dur
ing the unseasonable weather.
“It as not until 1891 that the
states began a real program of
road construction and New Jersey
has the honor of being the first
state to ceate a state highway de
partment. Two years afterwards
the Federal government appropri
ated SIO,OOO to. establish the Of
fice of Road Inquiry and for eight
years it kept on inquring, At the
end of that time the name of this
office was changed to the Office
of Public Roads . The constant
growth of state highway depart
jments naturally gave a larger via*
lon of the highway, requirements
and in 1912 the Congress created
a commission to investigate the
problem as to whether the Federal
government had a real duty in the
matter.
“For three years this committee
made a thorough investigation and

IMPROVEMENTS TO START
SOON BENSON CANAL
I
BENSON, Dec. s.—At present
matters are looking favorable foi,
the placing of the $30,000 Benson
canal bonds, and of improvements
beginning soon. The water in the
canal will be cut off in a week or
so, it is said, and the cleaning of
the canal from end to end will
begin. . !
Under advice of its engineer, it
is thought the company will not,
widen the canal, as was planned,,
but will deepen it by raising the
embankments. This will be done;
perhaps as a part of and incident
to'the cleaning process. Widening
the canal, the engineer is quoted
<as pointing out, would but in-,
crease the surface exposed to the
tir, which would mean increased
.loss of water by evaporation. On
the other hand it has been suggest
ed the bonds were authorized by
the stockholders with the under
standing that the canal was to be
widened* some holding that the
widening is necessary and has
been demanded by necessity for
several years.
ENORMOUS METEORITE
FOUND IN GREENLAND
(United Pres*)
COPENHAGEN, Dec. 5. A
meteoric stone weighing seven
tons, and said to be the third
largest such in the world, is ex
pected to arrive here shortly in
the Dutch schooner Sokongen.
The stone was discovered by
Eskimos in 1918 on a-high ledge j
of rock fourteen miles inland
from North Star Bay, Greenland.
To get it to the coast 170 dogs
were hitched in teams to the
sledge on which the stone was
transported. Once aboard the
schooner the crew found that the
magnetic properties of the stone
affected the comnass so much,
that great difficulty was experi
enced in steering a proper course.
Upon its arrival here the stone
will be placed on exhibit in a lo
cal museum.
finally gave a favorable report.
In 1916 the Congress made its
first real appropriation for high
ways. Recent discussions on the
floor of Congress as well as cer
tain public adresses and published
articles would lead some to believe
that the Congress had not mad*e a
thoroughu investigation of this
.subject. The personnel of the Con
gress has changed greatly since
the report of the 19J5 committc.
There are now but four of this
committer—two Senators and two
members of the House—in govern
ment service, who were member*
of that committee of ten. An so.
lit is necessary to recall some
things which it was supposed' had
been thoroughly established in the
public mind.”
MINING ACTIVITY IN
COCHISE COUNTY IS

TOMBSTONE, Dec. s.—Con
siderable development work is be

The Gold Slope is working 25
men under the direction of W. A.

property has recommenced run
ning its mill. . The mill and all
other machinery are operated with
fuel oil motors, which increase
the mine production. The com

into Willcox for transportation of
ore.

shipments of silver lead ore to

C. K. Jacobso, who is managing
the property adjoining the Mys
tery mine is working through the
Mystery tunnel and carrying con
siderable development work, Mal
ley stated.
About 12 cars of silver lead a
month are being shipped to El
Paso by Wilson, Wheelock, who
are operating the McKittrick shaft,
according to Malley. The greater
part of the work is done by hand,
he continued, a force of about 25
[men being employed.' However
the air compressors are being re
paired and put in order for the
operation of compressed a ? r drills.
The mining situation is particu
larly bright in the district, Malley
concluded and it is only a matter
of a short time unt'l all of the
properties will be paying well.

CAMERON URGES LONG
GRAZING LEASES IN STATE
WASHINGTON, Dec. s.—Pres-j
ident Coolidge was urged by Sena
tor Cameron of Arizona to recom
men in his message to congress
passage of a bill which would per
mit cattlemen in western states to
lease public lands for grazing pur
poses, for a period of at least 10
.years. Under existing conditions
. the president was told, cattle
'raisers are permitted to use the
public domain from year to year
but with no assurance that they
will be awarded the same area in
succeeding years; and, therefore,
have not been able to fence the
lands and to put down water wells.
The historic rivalry between
I raisers and cattlemen of the west,
said Cameron, has passed to such
an extent that sheepman have
! joined with the cattlemeen in an
‘ effort to have grazing legislation
enacted.
; The senate public lands com
j mittee of which Cameron is a
member, plans to present a bill at
j the next session providing for a
ten-year lease, the senator said.

a Chicago banker, for organizing the
most gigantic swindle ever perpetra

one C. W. French who was operating
in this state about ten years ago.
C. W. French came here as a pro
moter of various schemes all of which
were suspicious on the face of them.
Ho was negotiating also for the pur
chase of a bank at Flagstaff. Stories
of his operations reached the authori
ties of Salt Lake, who sent to James
G. Simpson, then of the rcportorial
staff of The Republican, a list of ques

concerning the activities of Mr.
French.
It appeared that throughout his op

ceedingly thin ice, but it held his
weight But the Utah authorities be
lieved thoy had the goods on him and
sought his extradition. They sent an
aeent here to take him back. A hear

of extradition in which French was
represented by Robert S. .Fisher, took
place before Governor Hunt, who fin
ally refused to issue the warrant
The liveliest interest was taken all
over the country in the proceedings.
Papers in Chicago, New York, Pitts
burg and other eastern cities kept the
wires hot with their demands for news
about French.
It appeared that he also was wanted
at Akron, Ohio, where, by the way,
according to the dispatches of yester

GIRAND GRANTED PER
MIT FOR POWER SITE
AT BOULDER CANYON
On Tuesday of last week the Feder
al Power commission at Washington,
D. C, granted a preliminary permit
to James B. Girand, of Phoenix, for
the development of 150,000 horse
pow er of hydro-electric power.
The sito for development of this
huge amount of power is ,on the Colo
rado river, near the mouth of Diamond
creek in Mohave county, and it is pro
posed to generate sufficient power to
electrify the inter-mountain section
of the Santa Fe .railway, furnish pow
er and lights for all the towns in
northern and central Arizona and fur
nish the necessary power for all in
dustries in this section.
Until about three years aero Mr.
Girand was city engineer for Phoenix,
which position he gave up that he
might work out the details of this
project, which he has been workinsr
on for the last decade.
There are now eight different com

TWO VALLEY WOMEN
BADLY BURNED AT
STONEMAN LAKE
Mrs. A. N. Crawford of Clarkdalo
is lying today at the United Verde
hospital suffering from severe burns
on face and arms, and Mrs. H. P.
Hughes of Clarkdale is at her home,
badly burned about the arms.
The ladies and their husbands
were spending a short vacation at
Stoneman Lake and when they went
to prepare dinner they ""noticed that
the gasoline stove installed in the
cabin was leaking, the discovery being
made just after they had started the
fire. Mrs. Hughes called to her hus
band to come and ston the leak, but
before ho could ujnter the cabin, the
stove exploded and scattered the blaz
ing gasoline over both women. The
force of the explosion blew the door
of the cottage shut and it was several
minutes before Hughes could render
effective aid.
The men of the nartv realized thnt
the women were in need of immediate
medical aid and hastily nrenared for
the long automobile journey home.
With the innate perversity that some
times characterizes inanimate things,
the Hughes car refused to act proper
ly and a Ford was hastily borrowed
from a neighboring rancher. The long
journey ended about 2 o'clock this
morning just below Camp Veide when
the United"" Verde ambulance met the
party and made a quick trip with the
suffering women to the hospital.
As stated, Mrs. Hughes' burns,
while extremely painful, were not ser
ious and she was able to return to her
home. Mrs. Crawford's condition is
not considered at all dangerous, but
she will ,be compelled to remain at the
hospital for several days. Mr. Hugh
es is in the railroad department of
the United Verde and Mr. Crawford
is assistant assayer of the company.

BIG WIND AT NEEDLES
DOES MUCH DAMAGE
At 5:15 last Sunday afternoon
Ncedjes was visited by one of the
worst wind storms in its history. A
rain cloud came up from the south ac
companied by a strong wind and an
other came off the mountains to the
west. The latter was also accompan
ied by wind but of milder velocity.
The clouds and wind currents seem to
have met southeast of town and the
one from the south being considerably
stronger caused a whirlwind of trrcat
velocity to sweep through the city, do
ing uamage to an Kinas oi property,
but with few exceptions, the damage
was not 'of a serious nature. The
storm was accompanied by rain and
sharp and frequent flashes of light
ning and it certainly had the ear
marks of a fair-sized hurricane, the
velocity of the wind being probably
fifty or sixty miles an hour. Had it
been 110 miles an hour, as stated in
a report to county scat papers, there
would be"" no Needles today, and the
loss of life would have been great. As
it is no one was even hurt, which
seems a miracle in itself.
The loss of property damaged by the
wind will run into hundreds of dollars
but the greatest loss is to the many
trees uprooted in the various parks
and throughout the entire city, which
are a total loss and will take several
years to replace. Needles Nugget.

REMARKABLE METEORITE
FOUND NEAR NAVAJO
Now on exhibition at Navajo is a
remarkable meteorite, lately found
about 15 miles from that point by
Robert Thomas and Carl Hill. It
weighs about 4,000 pounds and is 33
inches in extreme diameter. Its ma
terial is a magnetic metal that is
heavier than iron and yet so malleable
that it may be hammered without
breaking to the ""thinness of paper.
Across the top is a deep crack, be
lieved to have been made in a remote
age when the celestial visitor dropped
into water and was suddenly cooled.
Analyses made show a large per
centage, but little platinum, in the
latter uoint differing from the me
teoric fragments gathered around the
great crater near Canyon Diablo, west
of Holbrook and Navajo. It is notable
also that smoothed faces of the Nav
ajo meteorite fail to show the Wid
mnnstattcn figures usually found and
quite prominent in all the Canyon Di
ablo fragments. These figures are
developed by the use of acid and,
fancifully, have been imagined writ
ings by means of which the people of
other spheres have attempted to com
municate with the inhabitants of the
earth.

THIS POOR BOOTLEGGER
SURE HAD FIERCE LUCK
All is not velvet for the bootlegger.
One was recently getting on a San
Diego train bound for Los Angeles
with a grip full of genuine goods
from across the line. As he put his
foot on the first step the handle of
his precious grip gave away and the
grip fell to the sidewalk. He left
hurriedly for parts unknown with the
piece of the strap handle while the
passengers soon congregated around
the spot and took a good whiff of the
banned stuff. As the train pulled out
the station agent kicked the grip in
side the station. You may guess the
rest of the story. Needles Nugget.

Security Board Pays
527 Benefit Claims
In D C. in 1938
«
Many to Be Eligible f
For Age Insurance
Checks Next Year
Every one who has a social
security account number should
know how the changes made by
the last Congress in the old-age
insurance provisions of the So
cial Security Act apply to him.
For the benefit of the readers of
The Star, the District field office
of the Social Security Board has
prepared a series of brief articles,
each explaining one point of the
new provisions. Following is the
fifteenth of this series.
How many persons in the District
of Columbia will receive payments
of old-age and survivors’ Insurance
benefits next year? This question
has been asked by many citizens
who are keenly Interested in their
welfare. No one knows the answer
to that question because no one
knows just how many insured work
ers will die. nor how many widows
and children will be left to claim
survivors’ benefits. Neither does any
one know how many insured work
ers will retire next year, nor how
many aged wives or dependent chil
dren of such annuitants there will
be to claim payments of old-age
insurance. -
Some idea of the number of claim
ants in 1940 may be obtained by a
glance at figures recently released
by the Social Security Board. In
the year 1938 a total of 527 claims
for lump-sum benefits were paid to
insured workers living in the Dis
trict. In .that same year 587 claims
were paid to relatives (or estates) of
insured workers who died. A like
number of insured workers may or
may not die next year, leaving sur
vivors to claim benefits.
Tf cVvvilH ha ramamka«>*<4 4
many insured workers who had al
ready reached the.age of 65 and re
ceived lump-sum payments prior* to
August 10, 1939, when the amend
ments went into effect, may also
have a chance to qualify for month
ly benefits. Since the old-age in
surance system went into effect Jan
uary 1, 1937, a total of 1,408 persons
living in the District reached the
age of 65 and claimed lump-sum
benefits, and many of them will be
eligible for monthly benefits next
year.
While there are no accurate fig
ures regarding the number of per
sons who will receive benefits under
the old-age and survivors insurance
provisions during 1940, it is esti
mated that Approximately 912,000
persons in the United States may be
entitled to monthly benefits before
the end of 1940. This assumes that
there will be approximately 485.000
primary old-age beneficiaries—that
is, persons 65 or older—who are fully
insured in their own right; 125,000
wives and 20.000 widows over 65
years old, 78 000 young widows with
dependent children, 194,000 de
pendent children and 10,000 de
pendent parents.

War of Our Concern,
Says Mrs. Roosevelt
By the Associated Press.
OKLAHOMA CITY, Nov. 1—“War
anywhere is a concern of our own,”
Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt said last
night.
""Our oceans* no longer are safe
guards against a military offensive.
“Whether we like it or not, Amer
icans today must decide what kind
of a peace they want from the pres
ent war. A nation that has been de
stroyed is of very little use to the
rest of the world as a market.”
""War in modern times is con
tagious, and other countries cannot
escape its effects.”
The only remedy for world affairs,
she continued, is to do away with
war in any part of the world.

Smithsonian Gets, Meteorite
Found in Indiana 55 Years Ago
Not a man from Man, but at least
a visitor from another world has ar
rived belatedly at the Smithsonian
Institution, it was announced4 today.
The visitor is a meteorite which
fell on an Indiana farm 56 years
ago.
Despite the long time since it
ascended, the mysterious substance
from the outer spaces still is of
great interest to scientists.
It was presented to the institution
by Stuart H. Perry of Adrian, Mich.,
and came from the collection of the
late John Collett, former State
geologist of Indiana, and there can
be no question of its authenticity,
says the announcement from the
Smithsonian National Museum.
The geologist's nephew, John S.
Collett of Indianapolis, furnished
these details:
“The meteorite was found In
Vermillion County in Holt Township
(Ind.) by a farmer who saw it
fall and heard the explosion as he
was walking from his barn to his
house between 9 and 10 o’clock in
the evening. The next day he ex
amined his fields and found a place
of fresh earth that looked as if a
small blast of explosive had been
discharged—a sort of ragged open
ing like a small poet hole. Upon
excavating he found the specimen
you now possess, which was brought
by the finder in person to the pro
fessor (Mr. Collett) at the State
House in Indianapolis.""
Actually to find a meteorite, or
""shooting star,” that has reached the
earth before being burned up by
friction of the air during its long
journey at terrific speed, is such a
rare occurrence that scientists al
ways are eager to examine it.
""Of all the millions of them that
must have reached the earth since
man appeared on the planet,” says
the institution, ""it is a strange fact
that there is no record of one ever
having struck a human being.”
The Holt Township specimen is a
meteoric iron about 3 inches long
by 2>4 inches wide, weighing about
half a pound.

SUSPECT CAUGHT
IN A CEMETERY
.
Police Have Three Battles
Wit hGang---Last at Day-
Break in Ravine
2
BOSTON, July 23—Eleven persons
including five police officers, were shot
last night by two desperadoes in the Ja
maica Plains district. One woman,
Mrs. Dela Fallon and three policemen
are believed to have fatal wounds. A
cordon of police armed with rifles and
revolvers, has been thrown around
Franklin Park, where the despeoradoes
took refuge. |
Bostom, July 23—As the final result
of three desperate battles with a band
of outlaws, the police captured one and
it is believed seriously wounded two
others, but the balance of the men es
caped.
The first passage at arms between
the blue coats and the law breakers
occurred Tuesday night in a bar room 1
at Jamica Plains, the second on the
streets of the town at an early hour
this morning and the third at du_\""
break. Guisseppe Zeppia, who is now
in custody of the police has bt-cn‘
identified as the man who shot up the
saloon which precipitated the trouble |
shat led to the fight. ‘
The officers were called to the scene
and began chasing -the disturber and
his companiow® who fled towards the
outskirts of the city and finally took
refuge in the cemetery. Forming a
solid line the blue coats advanced, in
the uncertain light, with the pursued
some distance in the lead.
They suddenly disappeared, and it
seemed as if the quarry was lost when
one of them rose up from behind a
tombstone and ran barefooted over
mounds and past granite shafts. His
clothes were ragged, and he wore over
alls. In one hand he carried a big re
volver, and close on his trail came the
officers. Again he disappeared, and
this time down into a ravine. The po
lice rushed up to its edge and peered
over. A shot came from behind a bush
where the man lay hidden, and this
was the signal for a general fusliade
during which more than 100 bullts
were exchanged.
Finally the firing ceased, and when
the officers scrambled down the steep
sides and puled away the foliage they ‘
found the man now in custody, rid-|
dled with bullets. ‘
He was taken to the Jamica Plains
station where he will be held pend
ing the results of the chase which was
zresumed, and in the hope that he can
te induced to make a confession.
He is one of a gang of foreigners
who are believed to be guilty of sev
eral strocious murders of recent occur
rence, and he will be put through the
third degrce in an effort to wring a
confession from him.

_Last season the fgnit crop was light
all over the Western' Slope. However,
the farmers ir the Grand Valley, which
includes Fruita, Clifton, Palisade and
Grand Junection, were paid $900,000
for their fruit. Of this amount the
Grand Junction association alone paid
out $700,000.
The farmers are not discouraged by
the fact that the heaviest loss by frost
ever suffered came this year ruining
orchard after orchard. They all have
money in the bank from last year’s
fruit and with their smudge pot ex
perience they feel that they will never
again lose their crops.

DRAFT AND HIDE ARE
TO BE GIVEN BRYAN
“Great” Democratic Demonstration Last
Wednesday---Mrs. Leavitt Will Return
Bearing Gifts---Coyote’s Pelt for
the Consolation Prize
STORY OF A MOST NOTABLE EVENT
From Thursday’s Daily Post.
When is a demonsration not a dem
onsration?
When the Demoerats attempt it, is
the answer to this original conundrum,
and the following story of last night’s
occurrences when this was attempted
will go to prove to every ome but a
Demoerat that such is a fact.
The origin gf the ‘“demonstration’’
last night came to the minds of lead
ers of the party in Glenwood Springs
about two weeks ago when, in company
with a number of others Mrs. Leavitt
was riding up Grand Canon on horse
back.
A coyote loped ahead of them for
several miles before taking to the tim
ber, and several.times-the party way
near enongh to see that he was the
posscssor of a very fine hide. Mrs,
Leavitt expressed the warmest admira
tion for his winter coat, so two of the
men rode back to a ranch house and
securing a rifle managed to kill Mr.
Coyote after he had taken to the tim
ber.
Of this, however, Mrs. Leavitt
knew nothing, those in the party say,
and when the question of presenting it
to her came up, the idea grew that it
would be well to make the hide gift
event one notable in the history of
Garfield county.
But if Bryan’s daughter had a hide
and the great commoner were forgotten
the Democrats thought that their lead
er might feel neglected so another cne
was killed fcr Bryan.
There was a suspicion in the hearts
of many cf the loyal ones tha:c if le
was unable to get Taft’s political hide
this fall, that one of a coyote might be
a sort of a consolation prize, thongh
the latter wuld not be one-tenth as
large.
Last nizht was the great might, lut
previous 1 this it was suggested toat
the Demoernie sheuld contsibute ‘herr
mites to ' camprign fund, sal that
it would boa gracious thing to nave
Bryan’s daughter present he: father
with n Araft fur 11 that e:2' T be eol

canvass made, and an amount sail to
be between $23 and SIOO was secured
BOMB IS EXPLODED IN A TENT
CHICAGO, July 23—A bomb was ex
ploded last night in a tent where Gov.
Dencen was addressing a political
meeting, and in the panic which en
sued some were badly bruised. Gov.
Deneen and others on the platform
tried to quiet the crowd, and prevent
the panic, and after an investigation
had been made many returned and
heard the rest of the address.
The explosion has been attributed to

RACE WAR SEEMS IMMINENT
NATALBANY, La., July 23—Day
light this morning found the town of
Natalbany divided into two warring
camps, with the prospects of blodshed
‘before night, very bright. Relations
A band was scheduled to play and
lead the procession up to the Napier
home. But the band got lost in the
shuffle, and the mandolin club was se
cured instead.
The large crowd which finally follow
ed the music consisted of thirteen De
moerats, all of whom were aspirants
to political office, and three small boys
who thought there might be some ice
cream in sight at the end of the jour
ney. (They were dizappointed.)
Arrived at the home, the mandolin
club played: ‘‘Hiding in the Moon
light’’ then the self invited guests
tool:l possession of the parlor, and the
cre presented by Mayor Drach in
! R‘\:fdeﬂ speech.
| They were accepted by Mrs, Leavitt
i_in a witty little talk, in which she
'showed that she knows how to speak
and what to say.
The $23-SIOO draft was not present
ed as al of that amont had not been
gotten together, but it is understool
‘that it will be forthcoming before
Mrs. Leavitt’s train leaves tonight.
It was not until last night, however,
’tlun the nigger in the wood pile, whose
presence has been suspected since the
reception at the Colorado, showed his
‘ face.
Persistently it has been claimed that
her visit had no political significance
whatever. None at all. But when the
draft part of the program was pulled
off, the truth came to light.
I'or even William J. Bryan must ad
mit that a draft presented by his
daughter for campaign purposes has
some politieal significance. and when it
is recalled that this was the erowning
event of her stay the claims of those
who insisted it was just a social visit,
must be disallowed.
The Domoerats meant well—well,
they always have, but doubtless the
famous resident of Fairview will take
great satisfaction in viewing the scalp
| his charming daughter secured for him
lin the wilds of Colorado when that
l‘mhur scalp he wants so badly is far
beyond his reach at the White House,

sensationalism have attributed it to an
attack of anarchists who sought the
governor’s life. But the conservative
ones say that it was merely. a device
of the opposite political party to break
up the meeting. This was being—m

section.
Soveral suspects were arrested, but
later released. The police are making
an investigation.

KILLED MAN IN
HEART OF DENVER
DENVER, July 23—William Me-
Mulkin, suspected of holding up R. L.
Everitt last night, was shot and killed
at the corner of Lawrence and 18th
streets at noon today. The revolver
was in the hands of Patrolman Frank
Campbell.
Descriptions of the men who held
Everitt up were given out at police
headquarters to the patrolman this
morning and all were cautioned to be
on the watch. McMulkin answered the
description closely but when the offi
cer stepped up to him and two men by
whom he was saccompanied and told
him he was under arrest all three be
gan running.
The streets were filled with people
and there was great excitement. Aec
cording to Campbell’s story he started
in pursuit of the trio, revolver in hand
when he fell over a wagon tongue. He
threw out his hands to protect him
self as ho fell and the weapon was dis
charged. The bullet passed through
MecMulkin’s body near the heart.
A diary found on his body showed
that he had been employed at Wol
hurst, the country home of Thomas
Walsh just outside of Denver. It is
filed with the names of Denver’s rich
est and most prominent citizens, as
well as distinguished guests who were
entertained at the Walsh home.

AYIESWORTH
IS EXONERATED
R . .
eport of Investigating Com
mittee Says President of
College Is All 0. K.
FORT COLLINS, July 23—A1l the
charges, insinuations and even intima
tions of immoral or improper conduct
on the part of B. O. Aylesworth, presi
dent of the Colorado Agricultural Col
lege and efforts from certain quarters
to make it appear that the college is
falling off in its effectiveness and an
rollment of students by differences
among the faculty, fell flat today when
the special committee appointed to
make an investigation made its report
to the state board of agriculture.
The committee submitted two sep
arate reports, the first one of which
dealt with the moral life of President
Aylesworth. It cleared him of every
suspicion, declaring that there was not
one scintilla of evidence to sustain the
charges. The second report took up
the matter of differences alleged to
‘exist among the faculty and the com
mittee declared that if the president
was to be criticized it was because he
was too lenient with both the faculty
and students and in the administration
of the college work, a condition, ae
cording to the evidence before the com
mittee, brought about largely by the
‘reason of disloyalty to the president
and the college on the part of some
members of the faculty and this dis
loyal spirit has been encouraged among
the students.
Both reports were adopted by the
board, but not unanimously, Governor
Harper, Eugene V. Grubb and A. A.
Edwards voting against them. The re
maining members of the board, who
voted for the adoption of the report,
were Capt. B. F. Rockafellow, presi
dent of the board; B. W. Dye, J. L.
Chatfield, Franklin E. Brooks, J. L.
Brush and Dr. R. W. Corwin.
USE OIL ON THE
STREETS OF DENVER
DENVER, July 23—Under the dirce
tion of Boulevard Expert George E.
Kessler, Mayor Speer is arranging for
experiments to be made on Denver
streete for a solution of the dust pro
blem through the use of residium oil,
on the plan successfully carried out
in Kansas City and other large places.
The Inland Oil company of Boulder
has consented to give gratis sufficient
oil to afford tests on five blocks. The
streets will be thoroughly flushed with
the oil. They will remain sticky for
about five days, at the end of which
time the oil will thoroughly settle. The
value of the oil lies in that it sucks
up the dust and keeps it allayed for a
long period without the aid of water
From the experience of cities where it
is in use streets much traveled will
have to be sprinkled with the oil on
the average of once every six weeks.
Moderately used residence streets need
only two applications a year.
Kansas City has used the oil for two
years with the greatest of success. The
cost of it for the first year was $6,000.
In the second year, in spite of an in
crease in street, park and boulevard
area, the cost was $5,000. The ex
penses here will probably be greater in
view of the fact that the price of oil
is much higher and the dust is a more
formidable enemy. Even if the experi
ments of Mr. Kessler prove a success,
Mayor Speer may hesitate about adopt
ing the system because of the eost.
FIRE AT BOARDING HOUSE.
TRINIDAD, July 23—Fire believed

The damage to the building and con
tents is S6OO. It is charged that the

whose name the autorities refuse. to
give out in the hope of securing his
arrest.

SERIOUS CHARGES RELATING TO IRREG
ularltics in tho administration of the postal
altairs have been formally preferred by Seymour
W. Tulloch, formerly cashier of tho Washington
city postomce. In a letter to tho postmaster gen
eral, Mr. Tulloch says that in all instances of ir
regularities and favoritism, tho proper allowances,
records, vouchors, etc., were carefully executed
and little Information can be ascertained by their
Investigation. Ho says that tho real facts behind
these allowances and vouchers are known to few,
""those Interested who will not and others, clerks,
who dare not talk."" This was probably meant
as a broad hint to the postmaster general to make
it easy for tho clerks ""who dare not talk,"" to
speak without fear of injury to themselves.
THE THING WHICH LED TO SUBSEQUENT
irregularities, abuses, and extravagances
and Anally Mr. Tulloch's removal from office, re
lated, according to the former cashier's state
ment, to tho purchase of a piece of office furni
ture. The chief of the salary and allowance di
vision of tho postofflce department desired a file
case, but his requisitions were rejected by his su
perior officer. Ar. Tulloch Eays that subsequent
ly vouchers were presented to him for this file
caso accompanied by an allowance for itB pay
ment out of the funds of th? Washington city
postofflce. Mr. Tulloch says that he directed the
contractor to obtain a certificate of delivery of
tho goods from tho chief of tho salary and al
lowance division, but that officer refused to ac
copt tho receipt fearing exposure during the audit
of tho vouchors and Tulloch says that ho refused
to pay for tho caso until some one was willing to
sign tho receipt. Mr. Tulloch further charges
that on one occasion tho first assistant postmaster
general sent his clerk to Tulloch with a voucher
for a lump sum for traveling expenses accompa
nied by an allowance for its payment from the
funds of the Washington city postofflce. Knowing
that such a demand was irregular, on its face,
Tulloch protested. Ho says that official became
very angry at the idea of a mere cashier at
tempting to make any suggestions to him and
refused to amend and itemize his voucher. Tho
Washington city postmaster sustained the posi
tion taken by tho cashier, but finally the auditor
of tle postofflce department sent word to the
cashier that if he would enclose the voucher in
his next account, the informality would be over
looked. Mr. Tulloch says that an inspection of
tho Washington accounts will show many similar
subsequent payments of traveling and other ex
penses on account of departmental officials with
out tho usual departmental checks.
rHAT POSTOFFIQE EMPLOYES WERE RE
quired to furnish a bond, the same to be
provided by a single recognized company, irre
spective of tho fact that such employes could fur
nish good personal bonds or might desire to avail
themselves of the competition in premiums be
tween other bonding companies, is another charge
made by Mr. Tulloch. He says that the Washing.
ton city postmaster had a conference with George
W. Beaver, then chief of the salary and allow
ance division, and reported that Mr. Beaver had
said ""Senator Piatt of New York would appre
ciate the fact if ho would select the senator's
company."" Mr. Tulloch admits that tho original
circular was subsequently modified by allowing
employes to select their own bonds or bonding
companies.
SEVERAL MYSTERIOUS TRANSACTIONS
with relation to the purchase of high-priced
furniture are referred to by Mr. Tulloch. In these
the name of Perry S. Heath, formerly first as
sistant postmaster general, figures, and not entire
ly In a creditable way, if Mr. Tulloch's statements
are to bo relied upon. That a complimentary pay
roll was maintained in the postofflce department.
Is another charge made by Mr. Tulloch. In thi3
it is, claimed that certain men and women wero
paid money out of the public treasury without
doing any work. It is also charged that a num
bor of persons designated as finance clerks, audi
tors, etc., wero paid from $200 to $300 each per
annum more than their lawful salary. Mr. Tul
loch says that with only on 3 or two exceptions,
the positions as cleaners, char-women, laborers,
etc, were evasions of the civil service law and
the parties did not perform their duties Implied
in their official designations and often no ser
vice whatever. It is further charged that on one
occasion, a Porto Rican official was called dowa
sharply by the Washington office with reference
to irregularities in. his money order account Ho
wrote back, ""Perhaps if you knew who my in
fluence is, you would not write to me In such a
manner."" Mr. Tulloch says the postal accounts
of this official became so confused and full of
errors that ho refused to pay his salary. Re
f erring to this official, Tulloch says: ""He sur
prised me one day by calling and demanding his
back pay. This was refused until his accounts
had been audited. He replied, 'Very well, at your
convenience. I have been appointed to a $1,400
position in the land office.' "" Mr. Tulloch says
that at the time of his removal most of the offi
ces in Porto Rico were in arrears, some of them
for a considerable amount, and that the accounts
were very much confused. Mr. Tulloch goes into
details, making many charges affecting the reg
ularity and honesty of the postal service and
among other things charges that during the last
four years the members of tLe household of the
postmaster at Washington city have drawn' for
their services $40,000 from the local postal rev
enue. ? &
IN RESPONSE TO THE CHAKGES MADE BY
Former Cashier Tulloch, Postmaster Gen
eral Payne has sent a letter to the comptroller
of the treasury, the auditor of f-3 postofflce de
partment, and other officials calling their atten
tion to Mr. Tulloch's statements and asking for
any explanation or further information that might
throw light on the subject Mr. Payne says that
""if those officials allow improper accounts to be
audited or suppressed, what might be called 'pay .
dirt' had been found In tho charges itapugning
their good faith and integrity."" Mr. Payne added
that irregularities do not necessarily mean any
thing unlawful. The department may pay out of.
its own fund either. by accident or design and
that need not be unlawful. Mr. Payne says tie
charges will be thoroughly investigated and Sena
tor Thomas C. Piatt takes a hand in the discus .
sion to enter a flat denial of Mr. Tulloch's state
ment relating to the bonding companies. Sena
tor Piatt says that he has no interest in any such
company.
A BILL IS PENDING IN THE LEGISLATIVE

etian, but Roman bricks. Moreover, when they
were manufactured they were not manipulated
like modern bricks, but were formed from slices
of clay as it was found, without the natural lay
ers being disturbed. This process resulted in
each individual brick being able to support a
weight quite four times as great as the modern
ones. Tho bricks examined are of the first cen
tury. One bore the impression of a' horseshoe,
conclusively proving the debated point that horse
shoes then were in use.

THE DESCENDANTS OF JAMES AND
Henry Leonard, who were the first iron
masters in America, have undertaken - to com
memorate the establishment of the iron industry
in tho United States by tho erection of a monu
ment at Taunton, Mass. Tho sum of $40,000 has
already been pledged to this plan. The Taunton
correspondent for the Chicago Inter-Ocean says:
""A design has been completed by Mr. Charles
Henry Niehaus of New York. It shows a shaft,
which may be of marble or granite, intended to
be seventy-five feet in height, resting on a granito
pedestal. Around the base ot the shaft are
grouped twenty-one figures, representing iron
workers and phases of the iron industry in early
days. The first iron works in the United States
were established at Saugus, mass., In 1643. Three
years later a furnace and forge were put in oper
ation at Braintree, and in 1G53 the industry was
established on a more extensive scale at Taun
ton. A portion of the plant stood for more than
200 years.""

DO DIAMONDS COME FROM THE SKIES? IS
an interesting question dealt with by a
writer in the Chicago Inter-Ocean. This writer
says that the 'theory was first broached by Mey
denhauer. According to this authority, the dia
mond can be of cosmic origin only, having fallen
as a meteorite at a late period of the earth's
formation. The localities where diamonds are
found contain tue residues of riot very compact
meteoric masses which may have fallen in his
toric ages and penetrated more or less deeply
according to the more or less resistent character
of the surface where they fell, 'juie Inter-Ocean,
writer adds: ""The most striking confirmation of
the theory comes from Arizona. Here on
broad plain over an area about five miles in
diameter were scattered 1,000 to 2,000 masses of
metallic iron, the fragments weighing from half
a ton to a fraction of an ounce. There is littlo
doubt these masses formed part of meteoric
shower, although no record exists as to when the
fall took place. Curiously enough, near the cen
ter where most of the meteorites have been found
is a crater with ragged edges, three-quarters of a
mile in diameter and about 600 feet deep, bear
ing exactly the appearance which would be pro
duced had a mighty mass of iron or falling star
struck the ground, scattering in all directions,
and burled itself under the surface. Dr. Foote
in cutting a section of this meteorite, found the
tools were injured by something vastly harder
than metallic iron. He examined the specimea
chemically and soon afte- announced to the scien
tific world that the Arizona meteorite contained
black and transparent diamonds. This discovery
was verified by Professors Friedel' and Noissan,
who found that it contained three varieties oJ

SERIOUS CHARGES RELATING TO IRREG
ularities In tho administration of ttie postal
altalrs havo been formally preferred by Seymour
W. Tulloch, formerly cashier of tho Washington
city postofflce. In a letter to tho postmaster gen
oral, Mr. Tulloch says that in all instances of ir
regularities and favoritism, tho proper allowances,
records, vouchors, etc., wore carofully executed
and little information can be ascertained by their
investigation. Ho says that tho real facts behind
these allowances and vouchors are known to few,
""thoso interested who will not and others, clerks,
who dare not talk."" This was probably meant
as a broad hint to thq postmaster general to make
it oasy for tho clerks ""who dare not talk,"" to
speak without fear of injury to themselves.
-pHE THING WHICH LED TO SUBSEQUENT
X irregularities, abuses, and extravagances
and Anally Mr. Tulloch's removal from office, re
lated, according to tho former cashier's state
ment, to tho purchase of a piece of ofllco furni
ture. Tho chief of the salary and allowance di
vision of tho postofllce department desired a fllo
case, but his requisitions were rejected by his su
perior officer. avr. Tulloch eays that subsequent
ly vouchors were presented to him for this fllo
case accompanied by an allowance for its pay
mont out of the funds of th, Washington city
postofllce. Mr. Tulloch says that he directed the
contractor to obtain a certificate of delivery of
tho goods from tho chief of tho salary and al
lowance division, but that officer refused to ac
cept tho receipt fearing exposure during the audit
of the vouchors and Tulloch says that ho refused
to pay for tho case until some one was willing to
sign tho receipt. Mr. Tulloch further charges
that on one occasion tho first assistant postmaster
general sent his clerk to Tulloch with a voucher
for a lump sum for traveling expenses accompa
nied by an allowance for its payment from the
funds of the Washington city postofflce. Knowing
that such a demand was irregular, on its face,
Tulloch protested. Ho says that official becanis
very angry at the idea of a mere cashier at
tempting to make any suggestions to him and
refused to amend and itemize his vouchor. Tho
Washington city postmaster sustained the posi
, tion taken by the cashier, but finally the auditor
of the postofllce department sent word to the
cashier that if he would enclose the voucher in
his next account, tho informality would be over
looked. Mr. Tulloch sayB that an inspection of
the Washington accounts will show many similar
subsequent payments ot traveling and other ex
penses on account of departmental officials with
out the usual departmental checks.
THAT POSTOFFIQE EMPLOYES WERE RE
qulred to furnish a bond, tho same to be
provided by a single recognized company, irre
spective of tho fact that such employes could fur
nish good personal bonds or might desire to avail
themselves of the competition in premiums be
tween other bonding companies, is another charge
made by Mr. Tulloch. He says that the Washing.
ton city postmaster had a conference with George
W. Beaver, then chief of the salary and allow
ance division, and reported that Mr. Beaver had
said ""Senator Piatt of New York would appra
clato the fact if ho would select the senator's
t company."" Mr. Tulloch admits that the original
circular was subsequently modified by allowing
employes to select their own bonds or bonding
companies.
Jf ST
SEVERAL MYSTERIOUS TRANSACTIONS
with relation to the purchase of high-priced
furniture are referred to by Mr. Tulloch. In these
the name of Perry S. Heath, formerly first as
sistant postmaster general, figures, and not entire
ly in a creditable way, if Mr. Tulloch's statements
are to be relied upon. That a complimentary pay
roll was maintained in the postofflce department;
Is another charge made by Mr. Tulloch. In thi3
It is, claimed that certain men and women wero
paid money out of the public treasury without
doing any work. It is also charged that a num
ber of persons designated as finance clerks, audi
tors, etc., wero paid from $200 to $300 each per
- annum more than their lawful salary. Mr. Tul
loch says that with only ons or two exceptions,
the positions as cleaners, char-women, laborers,
etc, were evasions of the civil service law and
tho parties did not perform their duties Implied
in their official designations and often no ser
vice whatever. It is further charged that on one
occasion, a Porto Rlcan official was called dowa
sharply by tho Washington office with reference
to irregularities in. his money order account Ho
wrote back, ""Perhaps if you knew who my in
fluence Is, you would not write to me in such a
manner."" Mr. Tulloch says the postal accounts
of this official became so confused and full ot
errors that he refused to pay his salary. Re
f erring to this official, Tulloch says: ""Ho sur
prised me one day by calling and demanding his
back pay. This was rofused until his accounts
had been audited. He replied, 'Very well, at your
convenience. I have been appointed to a $1,400
position in tho land office.' "" Mr. Tulloch says
that at the time of his removal most of the offi
ces in Porto Rico were in arrears, some of them
for a considerable amount, .and that tho accounts
wero very much confused. Mr. Tulloch goes into
details, making many charges affecting the reg
ularity and honesty of the postal service and
among other things charges that during the last
four years the members of tie household of the
postmaster at Washington city havo drawn for
their services $40,000 from the local postal rev
enue. TN RESPONSE TO THE CHARGES MADE BY
1 Former Cashier Tulloch, Postmaster Gen
eral Payne has sent a letter to the comptroller
of the treasury, the auditor of tla postofllce de
partment, and other officials calling their atten
tion to Mr. Tulloch's statements and asking for
any explanation or further information that might
throw light on the subject Mr. Payne says that
""if those officials allow improper accounts to be
audited or suppressed, what might bo called 'pay ,
dirt' had been found In tho charges impugning
their good faith and integrity."" Mr. Payne added
that irregularities do not necessarily .mean any
thing unlawful. Tho department may pay out of.
its own fund either. by accident or design and
that need not be unlawful. Mr. Payne says the
charges will be thoroughly Investigated and Sena
tor Thomas C. Piatt takes a hand in the discus .
sion to enter a flat denial of Mr. Tulloch's stato
ment relating to the bonding companies. Sena
tor Piatt says that he has no interest in any such
company.

that an employe leaving his work without giving
four nights' notice is to be assumed to have

$500 nne or a year's imprisonment with loss of
pension and will be ineligible in the future for
government employment The bill also forbids
interference with employes, tho collection of
strike funds or encouraging the strike in any man

ment, where the maps are made, Shirley

One of the most enthusiastic depart

vhere E. B. Preston, the assistant min
eralogist, is kept busy classifying sam
ples of minerals trreit are sent in. This is
done free of charge, and any one may
Front an educational standpoint if none
cthei these people would rind the museum
u most interesting- spot to visit. Its ex
hibit of sixteen thousand mineral speci

send in anything in the shape of a min
eral that is found in the -State and see
whether he has found diamonds or gold.
Nc assays or quantitative determinations
are made, but simply classsifying or iden
tifying, and the bureau has been instru
mental -in the discovery of many ' new
ores through the work of the iatxiratory.
Mr. .Preston has the assistance of.C. J.
Ysile. statistician, and they are both kept
bv.sy. Just now there are many samples
of black Band with platinum brought in,
for there is much inquiry about that pre
cious metal at present One man some
times brings in as many as twenty-six
s-amples of ore or mineral with the re
quest, ""Please tell me what this is.""""
The samples are put through a chemical
analysis and the man is tola the different
materials they contain. Miners ate often
sent to this department also when the
rush of business Is great with the State
Mineralogist, to find out how to work
ores, processes, etc. Capital from New
Jersey and New York is making inquiry
about the fine limes and clays of Cali
fornia and v San Francisco capital is in
terested also in the construction of plants
for the manufacture of cement. • It I is
expected that there will be a great' de
mand for cement later in the Orient and
manufacturers can ship the product frpm
here by way of Manila. In this depart
ment of the bureau one can see. . if he
be so disposed, the beauties of a common
rock as shown through a fine microscope,
and it will be found to be no mean, item
among nature's wonders. About two
hundred and fifty to three hundred- and
fifty samples of various rocks and. ores
are submitted to the laboratory every
month through the mails and by people
personally. This is one of the results ot
the industrial standpoint, so to speak,
from which the mining bureau is being
operated by Mr. Aubury, who has dis
carded old methods and is carving out
a way for himself. The bureau prepares
and issues a register of mines from each
county of the State, with maps showing
locations, etc. These maps are . a new
feature that no other -mining bureau In

To the library come many miner* and
men seeking information about the min
ing resources of California and mining
properties submitted to them for sale and
it is the aim of the librarian to supply
such data. Publications now being printed
on copper and gold dredging will fill a
great need. The new methods of yold
dredging used in Australia have been used
In the northern part of the State with
profitable success. The Inquiry for gold
mining properties is stronger than for
many years and gold mining has seen a
great revival in northern and other coun
ties. Prospectors are increasing. Large
capital is becoming interested in Califor
nia gold mines, much from. Ohio, Massa
chusetts and Illinois, while New York al
ways stands ready to put money Into a
favorable proposition. Much correspond
ence is answered from the bureau regard
ing slate, and slate quarries will be an im
portant factor in California one of these
days.
A force of men are always kept at work
in the field gathering statistics and other
information for the mining bureau and Its
publications. In the drafting room Is pre
pared all the matter for the illustration of
the various publications and the maps are
made there also. Work is now being done
on maps of Placer and Shasta counties,
showing the various mines, accompanied
by registers.
A working model of a stamp mill is a
thing of much interest to those interested
in gold mining. In a glass case la the
famous San Bernardino meteorite,, found
in the Manipah mining district. San Ber
nardino County. It weighed 128 pounds

analysis shows the various constituents of
which the monster meteorite it composed.
Iron, 94.94; nickel, 4.52: phosphorus, .07;
graphite, 10. Total, 99.67.
A curiosity with a history is a section of
a tree blazed by Kit Carson in 1S44. It
formerly stood on Carson Creek, Alpine
County, on the main divide of the Sierras.
Another section of a tree shown has pro
truding from it the handle and corner of
a coffee mill. A miner tacked it there
and then shifted camp and forgot it. But
the tree went on growing until the cof
fee mill was enveloped and close to : the
heart of the tree until only the small
part of it was left that is now visible. A
curious mass of pipes molded in brown

M theory that the diamond is of cosmic
M origin and has fallen as a meteorite at
M later periods of the earth's formation,
B there are evidences thereof, tho most
m striking confirmation coming from
M Arizona. Hero on a broad plain, over
M an area of about Ave miles In dlame-
M tcr, had been scattered ono or two
M thousand masses of metallic iron, the
M fragments varying In weight from half
M a ton to a fraction of nn ounce. There
M was little doubt these masses formed
M part of a meteoric shower, although
M no record existed as to when the fall
M took place. Curiously enough, near
M the center whero most of tho meteor-

M raised edges three-quarters of a mile
M in diameter and about COO feet deep,
M bearing exactly the appearance which
M would be produced had a mighty mnss
m of Iron struck the ground and buried
m Itself deep under tho surface. An an-
m clent meteorologist In cutting a sec-

M were Injured by something vastly
M harder than metallic Iron, and soon
announced that he had found black
M and transparent diamonds. Since this

M So look nut for meteors. They may

ADVICE FROM THE PROFESSOR.!
Perhaps Not Strictly In Order, but
Still Good Sense.
A young Southern lawyer sat In the
Supremo court in which Justice Hen
ry M. Glldersleevo was trying a case.
""This is the first t'mo I have ever
seen the Justice,"" be said, ""but if he's
as broad-minded as other members of
his family there'll bo no narrow ap
plication of the law in this case. A
relative of his, Prof. Glldersleove, was
my professor in tho University of Vir
ginia. I was in the same class of
which young Bradley Johnson, son of
the famous Confederate General of
that name, who died last fall, was a
member. One day several of us had
been out on a carouse and had failed
to appear for recitations. It was our
duty to report to Prof. Glldersleeve
and make our excuses. I think it was
I that was deputed to present the ex
cuse. I hadn't said much when the
professor broke in with a sternness
which made us wish wo couldn't tell
the difference between French wine
and corn whisky.
""'Young gentlemen,' he said, 'yon
must realize you havo entered upon
tho stern realities of life'
""Wo all bowed humbly, wondering
whether expulsion was to bo our fate.
'""Young gentlemen,' he added,
'never tnke It with water. I never
do. Good day, gentlemen.'"" New

The Things We Eat.
Gregory E. Owens, a food Inspector
of Manchester, had an odd experience
the other day.
He was examining tho meat In a
small butcher shop on a back street.
Tho greater part of the meat was
fairly good, but there was one lot of
pork nnd beef that was rather ques
tionable. Tho butcher stood outsldo with a
customer. Tho Inspector called him
in.
""Look here,"" ho said, ""what Is your
opinion of this meat hero?""
Tho butcher looked It over.
""I had forgotten all about that,"" ho
said. ""It Is pretty old stock.""
""Well, what Is your opinion of It?""
""My opinion,"" said the butcher
slowly, ""Is that It Is unfit for human
food; but It might do for sausage.""

World
EONI'ON. November ""o. Follow I
jug the vigorous protest of the social
;in l l political clubs attains! the reten
lion «.f war time drinking restrictions,
the Baldwin government is faced with
a t‘onservative revolt on the question
of innumerable vexatious war-time
restrictions which have been retained
in various forms under different acts |
of Parliament.
The occasion for t lie revolt will bo I
the government's attempt to pass tile j
‘•expiring laws continuance act” —an j
: ’mual measure which is neeessarx
lo enforce various luidget. customs
and excise taxation, etc., and to cover
various pieces of temporary legists
tom which the government lias not
had time to handle, but intends deal
ing with later. Normally this blanket
measure is ;xissed without much op
position, hut this year opposition has
developed through Home Secretary I
Sir William Joynson-Hicks having
written to the secretary of the Early
Closing Association to the effect that
the government intends including in j
the measure the ""shops, early closing;
n.-t of 1920.""
Now the ""shops, early closing act""!
contains many of the tnos; obnoxious;
1 cs| notions imposed h\ ""Dora"" ipopu-J
1 r n ime for ihe war time ""defense of j
tile realm act."" which made almost !
mix old tiling an indictable offensel. •
and if there is one thing Englishmen!
iv an! to shake off it is tits clutches of j
""I'<c a "" “Dora."" most hateful of ;
war-time regulations, was a blanket ]
measure which enabled the govern- !
roent to lmpo.se any kind of restrie- 1
tions on public and commercial life j
that thev. the government officials, j
considered necessary for the safety of
le'itain during the war. It was enact
'd on the promise that it was purely
a temporary war-time measure and
would he allowed to lapse as soon as
peace was restored.
Compromise Effected.
Rut many of the restrictions im- '
posed by ""Dora"" met with the entire I
approval of social reformers, as well
as groups of greedy traders and leis
ure-seeking employes, so that when
peace was declared the entire lapse of
""Dora” was regarded as ""inadvisable |
and undesirable."" The general public
insisted it was ""most desirable,"" hut
with tite coalition system of govern
ment still in force legislators compro
mised and met each others' views by
partial relaxations, continuing such
legislative provisions as they could not |
agree upon.
In the comparatively innocuous I
""shops, early closing, act. 1920."" were j
Included a number of ""Dora’s” little •
annoyances which drive the public I
crazy. ""Early closing"" as a law was]
never seriously opposed in pre-war]
days, ns the original act merely regu- 1
lnted the hours of employment and]
closing times of the big department '
and other stores and insured their em
ployes a half-dav holiday weekly, sim- J
liar to those in force in commercial i
offices and factory alike.
Rut t lie ""Dora"" version went a good !
deal further and laid down definite j
hours of closing for all kinds of stores.
It was tite independent and ""one-man"" !
stores that insisted on their right to ]
remain open till any hour they chose !
anti it was the big stores which con- |
tended that it would be unfair business J
competition to allow other Independent |
concerns to sell articles in hours j
closed to them. The obvious compro- :
mise to the legislators desirous of j
avoiding a lengthy session was to i
make minor concessions, hut to re j
Impose the general list of non-saleable j
articles within certain hours.
War Rule Still Effective.
As a result, seven years after the]
war Britishers find themselves unable ]
to purchase tobacco or cigarettes after i
S p.m. They may not buy chocolates !
alter 9:{ii p.m. ""Perishable” and’
""cooked foods"" may he sold tinlil 9 or 1
1"" p.m., hut canned goods cease to he j
on sale after 7 or S p.tn. (according to j
localities). But the trouble is the deft- I
nit ion of ""perishable” and ""cooked j
foods.’ and this varies according to I I
the views of storekeepers and the local I
magistrate.
I.ote shoppers find their choice of j
foodstuffs strictly but variously reg
ulated. Canned fish and other deli- j
cades may not he sold after 8 p.m. (7 j
p.m. in some districts), hut a restau- !
ranteur may serve canned sardines j
or prawns on toast as a ""meal.” In i
cidentally, a ""meal” of this descrip- ■
tion enables the eater to purchase !
drinks, and even a single cigarette or 1
cigar after normal ""booze” and to- j
banco hours j
Early Closers Finn.
So the list might he added to. and j
It would not seem a difficult matter j
to straighten out the anomalies, hut ]
here tite interested organizations .ioin
1 c =ue The Early (.’losing Association, |
itt behalf of store clerks, assistants. J
etc., strongly oppose store opening;
after 7 or R p.m. 19 or 10 on Satur- !
days), and the big employers insist j'
that if they have to close down it is j
unfair to allow independents (or oth
ers who would rather he open at dif
ferent hours) to sell produce compet
ing with them.
Were British shopping controlled by j
the big corporations there would he j
little more to say on the subject. The 1
big corporations have adjusted their]
prices, etc . to make their profits at j
least equal to those of pre-war days, ]
and they don't want any trouble with i
their employes. But the great mass I
of independent storekeepers are up in [
arms and contend thitt they must lie]
given the right to sell what they
please in whatever hours they like.
The general public objects to the
present chaotic system because it I
never knows what the regulations j
may be in various districts. Also the I
average citizen likes to do his shop-I
ping just when the mood strikes hint. I
and as long as there are stores open ]
to supply liis needs.
Machines Break I.atv.
The S o'clock tobacco and 9:30]
chocolate limit is the most exasperat- I
ing to Britishers, and all sorts of]
schemes for the evasion of the law j
have been tried and are generally
recognized. Chocolate and cigarette j
automatic machines tire installed;
everywhere, and the storekeepers will I
always provide small change for!
clients who wish to patronize these
use of automatons after hours.

a torrent of protest and it is certain |

consider its position. The ""Early |

The statistics showed that Great
Britain has replaced the United
States as the largest purchaser of
Canadian goods. During the 12
months Great Britain bought from
Canada goods worth $438,000,000, ap
j proximately $1,000,000 more than
| America’s purchases. This represents
a gain of $05,000,000 for Great Brit

PASSING OF THE ALLIGATOR.
Its Former Abandonee in Florida De
scribed by One Who Has
Hunted It.
• “In July, 1879, near my home in Polk
county, Fla.,” said Cyrus Baleher, ac
cording to the New York Sun, “I was
one of a party offline men w r ho joined
in an alligator hunt on what was
known as the Hooker Prairie, but in
reality was a chain of bayous. Within
an area of less than one mile around
we dispatched 224 alligators. They
ranged in size from three feet to 12,
the average length being seven feet.
“I came north 20 years ago and did
not go back to Florida until last win
ter, when 1 visited my old home. When
I expressed a wish to go out and bag
a few alligators folks looked at me in
surprise, and told me there hadn’t been
an alligator on Hooker Prairie in ten
years, and people around there had
almost forgotten what an alligator
looked like.
“Hunting the reptiles for the leather
market had caused them to become ex
tinct where they had once been almost
as plentiful as the flies that covered
them as they basked in the sun. And
with the departure of the alligators,
they told me, the flies had also almost
entirely disappeared.
“1 remember once. In those good old
alligator days, a party of us were out
deer hunting. Our dogs starteef a deer
and took it to the river, into which it
plunged, to swim across.
“It never got across, though. It was
captured by a big alligator and lugged
back to the river bank. When we fol
lowed the dogs to the spot we found
that the alligator had whipped them
off and had the deer half devoured. We
lost the deer, but got the alligator.
“Once another man and myself pulled
a ten-foot alligator from a burrow in
the bank by running a long-handled
boat hook into the hole, which the al
ligator seized in its jaws and held on
to. This was the same alligator that
had come out of the bayou the day
before where an old darky named
Gabe Doan had fallen asleep while
fishing, and bitten the old chap’s leg
off at the kn^e.
“I would no doubt have had the rest
of old Gabe, too, if two other fisher
men hadn’t heard his yells and hast
ened to the spot. When they ap
proached, the alligator slid into the wa
ter, taking Gabe’s leg along with it.
The men carried the darky home and
he got well, and 1 saw him stumping
around on the wooden leg that took
place of the one the alligator bit off.
“On one alligatoring trip along Hook
er Prairie I myself killed 1G big alliga
tors and destroyed more than two bar
rels of alligator eggs.^’
DIAMONDS FROM THE SKIES.
Meydenliauer’H Theory That Precious
Stone* Came to Karth a*
Diamonds from the skies, con
veyed to earth in meteoric showers,
is a theory first broached by Meyden
hauer. The diamond, he says, can
be of cosmic origin only, having
fallen as a meteorite at a late period
of the earth’s formation. The locali
ties where diamonds are found con
tain the residues of not very com
pact meteoric masses which may
have fallen in historic ages and pen
etrated more or less deeply accord
ing to the more or less resistent
character of the surface where they
fell.
The most striking confirmation of
the theory comes from Arizona, says
the Chicago Inter Ocean. Here on
a broad plain over an area about five
miles in diameter were scattered 1,000
to 2.000 masses of metallic iron, the
fragments w’eighing from half a ton
to a fraction of an ounce. There is
little doubt these masses formed part
of a meteoric shower, although no
record exists as -to when the fall
took place. Curiously enough, near
the center where most of the meteor
ites have been found is a crater with
ragged edges, three-quarters of a
mile in diameter and about 600 feet
deep, bearing exactly the appearance
which would be produced had a
mighty mass of iron or falling star
struck the ground, scattering in all
and buried itself under
the surface. Dr. Foote in cutting a
section of this meteorite found the
tools w T ere injured by something vast
ly harder than metallic iron. He ex
amined the specimen chemically and
soon after announced to the scientific
world that the Arizona meteorites
contained black and transparent dia
monds. This discovery was verified
by Profs. Friedel and Noissan, who
found that it contained three varie
ties of carbon, diamond, graphite and
amorphous carbon.
Presidential Visits.
Abraham Lincoln visited Kansas in
1859 and spoke at Elwood, Troy, At
chison and Leavenworth. Grant passed
through Kansas in July, 1868, with
Gens. Sherman and Sheridan and was
given a great ovation all the way.
Grant visited Kansas again in 18 <1 and
at Lawrence there were great doings.
Hayes was in Kansas in 18 <9 and made
a number of speeches. Neither Gar
field npr Arthur saw the Sunflower
Kvate. Harrison missed Kansas entire
ly in his big swing around the circle.
McKinley toured the state.—Kansas

Know Your Smithsonian
By JERRY O’LEARY, Jr.
Star Staff Writer
Editor’s note: The Smithsonian institution is one of the world’s greatest treasure
houses of Man’s study of the world in which he lives. This is the fourth in a senes of
articles about Washington’s famous museum.
THE NATIONAL MUSEUM has one of
the world’s leading collections of iron
and stone meteorites, those giant fragments
which come hurtling into the earth’s at
mosphere every day, but only a few are on
display.
Mankind is fortunate, indeed, that the
earth’s atmosphere and the friction of
speed burn most meteorites into destruction
before they reach the ground.
The largest specimen in the collection
is an iron meteorite from Goose Lake, Calif.,
which weighs 2,570 pounds. There Is a ring
meteorite—shaped like a gigantic school
ring—from Tucson, Ariz.
The most impressive display (shown
above) is the Bacubirito meteorite, cast in
plaster because it still lies in the mountain
ous Mexican state of Sinaloa, where it was
found. This meteorite is the second largest
ever discovered intact by man. It stands
11 feet 4 inches by 7 feet SVt inches by 3
feet 4 inches, dwarfing the girl in the
picture.
The Smithsonian’s collection of rocks,
stones, minerals and quartzes are fantastic
in size. These are the materials bearing
upon the history and composition of the
earth. Here are stalagmites and stalactites
from caverns; sinters from the hot springs
and geysers of Yellowstone National Park;
basaltic columns; giant potholes and other
examples of the work of the great glaciers.
Polished and etched surfaces are shown
in specially lighted cases.
Here also are the petrified logs to be
seen in the ancient fossil forests of Arizona
and the many forms of plant life which
contributed to the giant coal beds in the
United States.

Reported for Russ Satellite
WASHINGTON, Iff) — The Rus
sian “space ship” has increased its
time of orbit around the earth by
several minutes. U. S. scientists
as yet do not know how the
change was brought about.
A possible explanation is that
the changed orbit resulted from
release of the sealed cabin carry
ing a dummy space man. The Rus
sians said an astronaut cabin
would be ejected.
Another speculative theory is
that the space vehicle may have
carried some additional fuel
which, when triggered from the
earth, caused the sphere to go into
higher orbit.
The Air Force reported it had
been informed by the National
Space Surveillance Control Cen
ter at Hanscom Field, Bedford,
Mass., that tracking of the new
satellite had revealed that its
orbital period has changed from
91.18 minutes to 94.27 minutes.
Food & Drug Official
Asked to Resign After
Disclosure of Extra Income
WASHINGTON, lift — George
Larrick, Food and Drug Commis
sioner, said yesterday Dr. Henry
Welch has agreed to resign imme
diately as head of the FDA anti
biotics division.
Secretary of Welfare Arthur S.
Flemming demanded the resigna
tion after a Senate committee re
vealed Welch had received $287,
142.40 in outside income since 1953
from activities directly related to
businesses he policed as head of
FDA’s antibiotics division.
Senators heard testimony Wed
nesday that the money received
by Welch came primarily from
sale of reprints of scientific ar
ticles used to advertise and pro
mote drug products.
Light Training Plane Hits
Jet Airliner Over Paris
PARIS, l/P) — A twin-jet Cara
velle carrying 37 persons collided
with a light training plane 6,000
feet up yesterday. The airliner
landed safely with a great hole
ripped in the roof. The light
plane’s engine was still stuck in
the jet’s fuselage.
One of the passengers was
killed by flying debris. The pilot
of the light plane also perished.
The airline said 25 persons were
injured.
The Caravelle landed at Orly
Field at almost the same time
Soviet Premier Khrushchev left
there for Berlin aboard his spe
cial turboprop plane. Khrushchev
apparently was unaware of the
accident.
The collision took place about
five miles from Orly Field as the
Air Algeria Caravelle was coming
down for a landing after a trip
from North Africa.

ASTRONOMY NOTES
By OLAF HALVERSON
Meteors glow because they have
been rushed through space at
planetary speed, and, striking our
atmosphere is like striking a
match against a stone wall.
The friction causes the smaller
particles to burst into flame and
melt in a streak of fire. Thunders
and visible explosions sometimes
are heard when a meteor falls.
The meteors that fall to the
ground are called meteorites.
Occasionally a meteorite found
is very large, a few weighing sev
eral tons. The one brought by
Commander Peary from Green
land is 11 feet long, 5 feet wide,
and weighs 36 tons. This is now
on display in the Museum of Nat
ural History in New York City.
The predominating element in
one class of meteorites is iron,
generally combined with a small
amount of nickel.

Senator Says Cleveland
Industrialist Should Pay
For Dealings with Red Boss
WASHINGTON, IjB — Senator
Thomas Dodd (D-Conn) called in
a Senate speech Thursday for
prosecution of Cyrus Eaton, Cleve
land industrialist, for his dealings
with the Soviet Union.
Dodd said Eaton flew to Paris
to talk with Soviet Premier
Khrushchev after the collapse of
the summit conference.
“Eaton has violated the Logan
Act and ought to be prosecuted
for it,” Dodd declared.
The Logan Act forbids private
citizens from negptiating with for
eign powers with intent to influ
ence U .S. policy. It provides pen
alties up to three years imprison
ment.
Eaton, 76, arrived in Paris short
ly before Khrushchev departed.
They talked for about 15 minutes
at the airport.
Afterward, Eaton said Khrush
chev had expressed confidence
that “eventually both his country
and mine would reach a position
of understanding and friendship.”
Eaton also quoted Khrushchev
as saying he wished all capitalists
“had my point of view.”
Eaton has long been a critic of
some aspects of U. S. policy and
has declared that Americans need
to reappraise themselves and
their systems of philosophy and
government. He has repeatedly
called for better understanding
between the United States and the
Soviet Union.
On May 3, the Soviets awarded
Eaton their Lenin Peace Prize.
Eaton’s acquaintance with the
Soviet Premier began in 1958
when Eaton visited Moscow.

Spy Mentioned by Nixon
Sought to Break U.S. Code
WASHINGTON, Wt — Officials
said yesterday that an alleged
spy case mentioned by Vice Pres
ident Nixon involved an effort by
the Soviets to crack U. S. codes.
Beyond saying that code secrets
were the goal of the operation,
officials were silent. There were
reports, however, that coding ma
chines were being manufactured
in the Springfield, Mass., area,
scene of the incident.
Nixon said Wednesday at Buf
falo, N. Y., that a Russian em
ploye of the United Nations Sec
retariat was caught spying at the
time of Soviet Premier Khrush
chev’s visit to the 'United States
last year. Nixon said the case was
handled efficiently by American
authorities, without an interna
tional uproar.

METEORITE FOUND
LEWISTON, Mont., July 17. UP)
—A meteorite, three inches in di

was still warm when it was found
here by J. Ruckman five miles
from here. It fell in his front
yard and the grass was burned
away where it fell.
A Strange Situation,
Visiting Congressmen!
vVith resources of unexampled variety and abund
uncc in the field of the Alaska Railroad, under climati*
conditions identically the same as in the corresponding
latitudes of northwestern Europe, where more than 20,
000,000 people reside, the railroad is not financially
self-supporting, the country it serves is not developing
as it should, and no serious efforts have been or are be
ing made to better the situation by responsible officials
in Washington.
Why? That is the big question you will ask your- ■
selves at every mile of your journey through Alaska.
Why? Why? Why? , . 1
Coal of every grade from lignite to anthracite is
here; abundance of it, as you will see, literally trillions
of tons of it. Best authorities in Washington, Oregon
and California say that those three States alone offer j
a tremendous annual market for Alaska’s anthra-;
cite coal. Anthracite coal is brought from Pennsylvania
jand West Virginia to San Francisco and other cities of.
I the Pacific Coast and sold .at retail prices of $20 per ton.;
Alaska anthracite can be laid down in San Francisco
and other coast cities at a net cost under $10 per ton. j
A haul of 1,000,000 tons per year 'from the anthra
cite coal fields of the Matanuska district to. Seward at
I $2 per ton would yield $2,000,000 per year in revenues
to the Alaska Railroad.
Why is it not done? Why are there no coal bunkers
at Seward to handle any coal? Why have no efforts
i been put forth to do those obvious things of prudent j
| business?
It’s a strange situation, you will readily perceive.
On the Kenai Peninsula between the Kenai moun
tains and Cook Inlet and in the Susitna valley and its
tributaries there are forests of the best qualities of cot
jtonwood, aspen and birch, hundreds of millions of board
feet of them. The cottonwood in those regions, by de
pendable cruising, exceeds 4,000,000,000 board feet. It
| averages 20 inches in diameter, is straight and clear for
30 and GO feet to the first limbs. It makes the best ve
i neer of any wood for fruit packing crates, being, light,
tough and pliable. The California fruit and vegetable
industry needs 100,000,000 square feet of it every year.
It can be supplied from these Alaska forests at lower
| prices and of better quality than the unsatisfactory ma
| terial that State now is compelled to accept. Those cot
| tonwood forests run from 10,000 to 60,000 board feet per
I acre over many thousands of acres in places along the
| Susitna river and its' tributaries, and along the Mata
■ nuska and the Talkeetna rivers.
Why are these magnificent forests not developed?
j Why are no efforts being made to have them developed?
Tough wrapping paper made from cottonwood pulp
j also is in great demand all over the United States. Why
are no efforts made to provide mills to manufacture
pulp for the manufacture of such wrapping paper?
There are no other available forests of cottonwood
on the Pacific slope. Why is this Alaska cottonwood
not put upon the market? Why? Why?
The pulp industry for news print paper, too, why
| is it not developed? The spruce and hemlock in the
Chugach National Forest surrounding Seward, 200 miles
; east and west and 100 miles north and south, and the
II spruce and hemlock of the Tanana valley for 500 miles
; i above the Alaska Railroad at Nenana, all within the
• j field of the Alaska Railroad, to be rafted to it down the
! numerous rivers that bisect the timber, cruises
, | above 20,000,000,000 board feet. It is better pulp ma
• | terial than the spruce of Oregon and Washington, giving
• j tougher and longer fibre.
[ j The 20,000,000,000 board feet or more in that vast
5 forest is enough to produce 500 tons of newsprint per
, day indefinitely without depleting the supply. Most of

BUDAPEST, July 17 (jP) —Mag
yar and Endres brot the “Justice
for Hungary” down to a forced
landing 20 miles outside of the
city when they landed just as
their last drop of gasoline was
exhausted.
The plane was not damaged
and the fliers were unhurt as they
crawled out of the plane at the
end of their spectacular 3,200 mile
flight and the fliers were both
grinning broadly.
A few minutes before landing as
the plane roared over the city and
turned and circled before heading
in the direction of the airport it
seemed as if the whole city rais
ed its voice in a great roaring
cheer as the ship circled over the
the city just before coming down.
Thousands waited for hours the
arrival of the brave fliers and
were perched on roof tops, cran
ing out windows and jamming
the streets as the ship passed
over them.
Their circling the city cost the
fliers the glory of bringing their
ship down at the Matyasfoid Air
field but even so their’s was the
first flight since Lindbergh’s in
which the fliers set a definite
goal and came so close to hitting
it.
They landed at 7:30 in the af

averaged 135 miles an hour.

DELIVERED ELOQUNT BACCAL
AUREATE SERMON LAST NIGHT
Pastor of Hyde Park Presbyterian Chorch, Chicago, Gave
Gradttating Class of Canon City High School
Some Wise and Philosophic Ad
monition for Government
of Their Lives
The baccalaureate sermon address
ed to the members of the graduating
class of the Canon City High school
at the First Presbyterian church Sun
day night by Rev. Dr. Joseph Vance,
pastor of the congregation of the
Hyde Presbyterian church of Chicago,
was one of the most masterly dis
courses of the kind ever delivered
here and the students are to be con
gratulated upon securing him for the
occasion. Dr. Vance is one of the com
missioners to the Presbyterian gen
eral assembly, now in session in Den
ver and came here as the guest of
Rev. J. T. Thomas, whom he had
known from boyhood.
There was a splendid audience and
the sermon was in keeping with the
extraordinary character of the event.
Men and women of all denominational
affiliation had gathered to pay the
tribute of their presence to the mem
bers of the class and to listen to the
words of the distinguished speaker.
After an introduction by Rev. Thomas
in which he was eulogized as one of
the most eminent divines of his
church in the central west. Dr. Vance
said that it gave him pleasure to be
present and to be priviliged to speak
to the graduating class on some of the
things touching the future.
Dr. Vance prefaced his sermon by
describing the Greek love of athletic*,
particularly of running, because it
brought out the best physical char
acteristics of those who entered the
lists. He said It was the custom at
the Isthmian and Olympic games to
have erected upon the race course
three posts; one at the starting point,
one at the middle and the other at
the end. Upon the first was inscribed
the words, ""speed you.** on the sec
ond, ""do your best."" and. on the third,
""stop."" This he said was symbolic of
the race of life and is as applicable

The last issue of ihe Presbyterian

Eastern collector for a sum. said to

dow as it was when the world was
young.
‘'The most beautiful things I have
ever seen in literature, asserted Dr.
Vance, “are in the Bible.” He then
quoted the thirteen verses of the thir
teenth chapter of second Corinthians,
beginning, ‘‘Though I speak with the
tongues of men and angels and have
not charity, 1 am become as a sound
ing brass, or a tinkling cymbal.”
' This chapter.” he continued, ‘‘has
been alluded to as a rope of pearls.
In the beauty of its diction it is with
out parallel In secular language.""
The discourse was predicated on
the first clause of the last terse of the
twelfth chapter of first Corinthians,
which is as follows: ‘‘But covet earn
estly the best gifts.” It is not a crime,
according to Dr. Vance, to be am
bitious, provided the aspiration is not
in contravention to the precepts and
teachings of religion. Men and women
should covet the best books, newspap
ers and magazines, for by taking in
the best they receive a helpfulness
that would not be possible with infer
ior companionship. The best thing
that people can do is to link their
lives with God's and accept the plan
of salvation. If men and women would
get the best there is In life they must
let God govern it.
One of the best gifts is truth. It is
the thing more than any other worth
dying for. and. being true to the truth,
is pre-eminently the thing worth liv
ing for. Dr. Vance is more than ordin
arily eloquent and his enunciation so
clear as to leave nothing to be desired
so far as his delivery is concerned. It
was a distinct intellectual treat to the
people of Canon City to hear Dr.
Vance Sunday morning and Sunday
night, and. the large gatherings pres
ent on both occasions, proclaimed
thHr appreciation of his visit here.

PLANTED 50,000 TROUT
FRY IN UPPER BEAVER
BEAVER CREEK SUNDAY
George R. Cassedy, with several as
sistants, left here at 4 o’clock last
Saturday morning with 50,00 trout fry
for Upper Beaver creek, which they
liberated in its waters, six or seven
miles above Fancher’s ranch. It was a
very laborious and difficult matter to
get the fish so far up the stream from
the wagon road, and for a long dist
ance the cans containing the fish had
to be carried on the backs of men em
ployed by Mr. Cassedy for the pur
pose. The roads were so muddy from
the rain of the previous day that six
hours was required to drive from here
to Fancher’s ranch. Mr. Cassedy left
this afternoon to drive for Texas
creek from which place he will take
40,00 trout fry over into Custer coun
ty, where they will be turned loose In
North and South Colony creeks..
Lincoln Park Notes.
S. B. Whitlow has made some not
iceable improvements in the place oc
cupied by him on Sherman avenue.
The changes not only add to the
convenience of the family, but add to
the attractiveness of the corner.
Another Sherman aveune resident
who has greatly improved the looks
of his place is J. E. Freidinger. He
has grubbed out the peach fillers and
leveled and cleaned up generally.
The place of Mr. Beckwith as prin
cipal of the local school, for which
he filed no application, has been filled
by the election of Joseph Colgate,
a brother of Mr. Geo. E. Colgate. Mr.
Beckwith will seariously devote him
self to plans he has had in mind for
some years and which, if successful,
will advance him toward a cherished
goal without interfering with his Park
interests, as the school did.
The charter of the Grand Avenue
Chapter of the American Woman’s
League arrived and the members are
actively engaged in scouring their
quoat of subscriptions to Collier's
Weekly. Success, Delieneater, Every
body's and the National Daily . so
as to comple'e the requirements of
the Chapter House. New members are
being enlisted almost daily.
D. W. Ross has now completed the
cement ditch, curb, walks, culverts,
and the picket fence set in cement.
It has been rather a costly job. but
it has set the mark for the Park and
besides setting the community a good
example. Mr. Ross has settled his
fence and ditch troubles for the rest
of his days.
The new board of county commis
sioners are still at their good work
on the Park roads. McKinley and
Grande have been receiving atten
tion as well as some of the further
out streets.
Now that the county commissioners
have graded McKinley street, it would
be a fine thing if the school board
would grade and sand some walks
at least along the school grounds or,
better yet, from Sherman to Grand.
That is an especially bad place and
one that is much traveled on foot.
The school yard is also in greea!
need of another sanding.

CHRISTIANS TAKE ONE

Prof. Thompson's class of the First

the First Christian S. S. last evening,
and was defeated by one score. The
(came was an interesting one from the
start to finish, and finished mighty in
teresting for the Christian men in
view of the fact that they were defeat
ed in a previous game by the same
team. The score on this occasion was
12 to 11. There were about 100 rooters
and spectators present and a good

THE ESSENTIALS FOR A
GAME OF BASE BALL SIM
PLE AND INEXPESIVE
The essential apparatus for base
ball Is simple and inexpensive. All
that is required is a held, a stick, the
ball itself, and police protection for
the umpire. One advantage of the
game as played professionally, is
that those sitting in the grand stand
can play the game a great deal better
than the eighteen men on the dia
mond. It is also true that any one of
the spectators, even though perched
on a telephone pole across the street
or lookiog through a knothole in the
fence beyond right field, can judge of
the pttcher’a skill or the runner's
fleetness, much more intelligently
than the arbiter who stands behind
the battery. The great merit of the
game is that the people can partici
pate in It. It Is not Uke bridge
whist. Its science is not synonymous
with silence. The thing to do la to
take off your coat and root as long
and as loudly at you can, even if
you don't knew what ta happening.

The Harlequin Cabbage Bug
This insect is more common in the
Southern part of the United States
than in Colorado; nevertheless, it has
made its appearance in districts far
toward the north of the state. It be
longs to the true bugs and, of course,
does its injury by sucking the juice
from the leavsß and stems of the
plant, causing them to wither and the
plant to die. It is injurious to cab
bage. mustard, radish, and other
plants of this nature.
The eggs are very small and usual
ly deposited in two parallel rows,
about a dozen in each bunch. The
newly hatched insects are green,
marked with black, but as they grow
they become flattened, bright red,
black, and yellow markings. The eggs
hatch on the tird or fourth day af
ter laying, and the young bugs are
ready to reproduce many generations
during the season, which permits the
insects to become very injurious
where they have secured a foothold.
The insect is very difllcult to kill.
Even the ordinary remedies for bugs
appear to have very little effect upon
this insect. This may be helped by
planting a trap crop of mustard,
which attracts the insects from the
main crop, and where the kerosene
emulsion may be applied with suffi
cient strength to kill both bugs and
plants without, of course, loss to the
crop. Sometimes the planting of
radishes among the cabbage plants
will attract the bugs away from the
cabbage and prevent injury for the
present.
As already stated, this is a south
ern insect, particularly. It will not
live over in our Colorado climate in
any except the mildest winters. Con
sequently, if upon its appearance it
can be kept from doing injury during
the current year, there is little pros
pect that It will survive the winter
and form a serious pest the next year.
This makes the use of trap crops es
pecially applicable to conditions in
this state.

WRITES BOOK TO VARY
THE MONOTONY OF HIS IM
PRISONMENT IN THE PEN
To relieve the monotony of life in
the Canon City penitentiary, D. W.
Silverhorn, one of the smoothest
crooks ever arrested in this city, is
turning his attention to literature and
has written a letter to The Gazette,
offering for publication his ""Reminis
cences of a Russian Spy.” The stories
are supposed to concern his own ex
periences in various parts of the
world.
The fluency with which Silverhorn
could rattle off fairy tales about him
self. while he was in the toils in this
city, gave him the reputation among
local officers of being a dope fiend and
the most entertaining liar they had
ever encountered. Shorn of all imag
inary stunts, however, the criminal
record of Silverhorn as a confidence
man and burglar, was sufficient to
earn him a sentence of 10 years in the
penitentiary at the hands of Judge W.
S. Morris for grand larceny committed
in this city. Silverhorn who has been a
globe trotter, has considerable educa
tion, is a good penman and his face
tious disposition is shown in the fol
lowing reference to his sentence in
the district court. In his letter to The
Gazette he says:
""In February 190 S at the sincere ad-,
vice of my advising physician. Judge

a life of dignified retirement for a
period of 10 years. But as this popular

CARBOLIC ACID USED
IN KILLING DANDELION
In a happy and decidedly successful
solution of the dandelion problem at
the State School of the Deaf and Blind
in this city, Superintendent W. K.
Argo is using a small portion of mon
ey left by the late W. S. Stratton. Mr.
Stratton bequeathed a certain amount
to the school, the interest on which is
to go for prizes among the pupils. Su
perintendent Argo has offered prizes
to the boys digging up the most dan
delions on the school grounds, and
about 30 boys are working on the
lawn several hours ev -y day. They
wear bibs and overalls, and carefully
save the extracted dandelions in their
pockets, to be counted and placed to
their credit at the close of the day.
The grounds are rapidly being rid of
the troublesome flower.
W. D. Pierce, manager of the Fair
mount and Riverside cemeteries in
Denver, is actively engaged in a cru
sade against dandelions, and his meth- ‘
od. which seems to be most efficient,
might well be adopted by Colorado
Springs people whose lawns are over
ridden with the yellow pest.
Pierce puts crude carbolic acid,
which costs 50 cents per gallon, in an
oil can, and places four or five drops
in the head of the dandelion. This acid
soaks into the roots, and in a day or
two the whole plant, root, branch and
stem is dead. Many local residents
have used gasoline with success in
killing dandelions, as suggested in a
Gaxette editorial yesterday.
Mayor W. H. Spurgeon has delayed
setting a date for a general “house
cleaning day*’ in Colorado Springs, for
a few days, until the funds in the
street department will warrant the
extra expense inonrred in hauling
away the rubbish collected by house
holders.—Colorado Springs Gazette."
