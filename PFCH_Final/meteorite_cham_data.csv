The Hunt
tor a
Meteor Which Hit
Our Earth Ages Ago
and Is Believed
to Be One Huge Gem
Worth Untold Billions of
SEVEI
of
Bin
iEVERAL years ago a syndicate
mining men commenced
sinking a shaft in Arizona to
reach the largest diamond in the
world, believed to be no less than
half a mile thick. This shaft la now
fifteen hundred feet deep. Three or
four hundred feet more, it is ex
pected, will reveal the great prize.
The scene of this most wonderful
mining operation Is Meteor Moun
tain, Arizona. The mountalti'is such
in name only, as it is little more
than a butte, rlslns two hundred or
three hundred feet above the desert,
about ten miles from Canyon Dlabolo
(Station, on the Santa Fe Railroad.
Viewed from a distance Meteor
Mouutalu looks little different from
the countless other buttes that rear
1 heir heads above the Southwestern
desert. But as soon as one begins
!.o climb its sides, strewn with
meteoric fragments, he realizes that
he is on the threshold of one of the
world's greatest scientific mysteries.
From the top of the ""mountain""
one gazes into a bowl-like depression
in the earth six hundred feet deep
and a mile across. It is in appear
ance like a volcanic crater. .
Scientists agree that this crater
marks the place where a giant
meteorite, as large as the circum
ference of the bowl would indicate,
struck the earth in ages past, per
haps a million of years ago, and
burled Itself deep iuto the bowels
of the earth Just how deep it is
the purpose of the mining syndicate
to find out.
When this giant mass struck the
earth there was no butte there; the
butte was created when the meteorite
struck, its tremendous weight dis
placing strata of rock, sending huge
clouds of dust into the air and form
ing the ""mountain"" as it exists to
day. . ' "" ""
After the meteorite sank into the
earth the sand and dust settled into
the depression. The drift of ages
sifted over the edges of the huge
bowl and assisted in the work of
covering the meteorite.
But the most remarkable thing
about this meteorite, apart from its
prodigious size, is the fact that in
all probability it consists of one
huge diamond! This is inferred from
the fact that numerous large frag
ments of the meteorite fouud in the
crater, and which are unusually
heavy, were found, upon investiga
tion, to contain, . besides meteorio
iron, large, hard, black diamonds ct
great value.
Even if the meteor itself consists
only of black daimonds its value
would be. quite inconceivable,, for a
good black diamond, though worth
less as a gem, is worth even more
than1 a white one for mechanical
purposes. It is quite probable, how
ever, that the bulk of the meteor
consists of white diamond, in which-

The largest diamonds In the world,
including the Koh-l-noor, the Culll
nan, the Great Mogul of Russia, the
orlon. the Great Premier diamond,
the Tiffany diamond, the Etolle Po
laire, and a dozen others of the tame
standard, worth in the aggregate
hundreds - of millions . of dollars,
might all be placed together In an
ordinary . derby hat and not reach
the top. - This meteoric diamond,
scientists believe, must be at least
half a mile thick! The significance
of this comparison Is apparent
It baa long been supposed that all
hi
t4
diamonds might be of meteoric ori-
gin, the scientists being unable to .
.agree whether the bottomless bores in
which they are found and which are
known as ""diamond pipes"" are the
result of ancient volcanic action ex
plosions of subterranean laboratories
which are nature's diamond factories,
or of meteors which are themselves
the crucibles from celestial regions in
which the diamonds are produced.
The latter theory has many dis
tinguished supporters, of whom the
most eminent .perhaps, is Sir Will
lam Crookes, the great English sci
entist. Sir William examined one of
the fragments of the great Arizona
meteor and found it to contain dia
mond crystals. Speaking of the
""pipes"" in which diamonds are
found at Klmberley, Sir William
said :
""They are irregularly shaped
round or oval pipes extending ver
tically downward to unknown depths, ,
retaining about the same diameter ;
throughout.
""How these great pipes were orig
inally formed It is hard to say. They
were certainly not burst through in
the ordinary manner of volcanic
eruption, -Blnce the surrounding and
enclosing walls show no signs of
igneous action.""
It Is well known that meteors are
In an Incandescent state when they
reach the surface of the earth,
brought to white heat by friction
with our atmospheres It has been
suggested that the meteor thus be
comes a crucible which furnishes
both the intense heat and the tre
mendous pressure necessary to
liquify and then to crystallize car
bon. .
. Scientifically, therefore, there is
every reason to believe that the Ari
zona meteor Is well worth the years
of effort and the hundreds of thou
sands of dollars that have been spent
in trying to locate it; the only ques
tlon being whether it is imbedded so
deeply that all human efforts to dis
lodge It will prove fruitless.

has been the subject of Indian tra
dition. The Mokls have a tradition of a
blazing star which fell ages ago,
when Old Man Coyote was a talking
animal and when the oldest of the
abandoned cliff houses in the South
west was new. The legend tells how
the Mokis had offended the Great
Spirit, and finally a warning was

which lighted up the earth for hun

shock was so terrific that several
Moki villages were all but ruined.
The Mokis heeded the warning, and
since the falling of the blazing star
they have so walked in the paths
of rectitude that they are among the
favored peoples of Manitou.
. Aside from mere curiosity and
speculation, the spot where the great
meteor fell was of little interest to
humanity until a wandering sheep
herder, who had been grazing his
flocks in the vicinity of Meteorite
Mountain, picked up a fragment of
meteorite which, besides meteoric
iron, proved to contain hard, black
diamonds of great value for mechan
ical purposes.
The earth in the vicinity of Mete

News of the discovery on Meteor

strenuous efforts to keep it quiet,
and a syndicate was formed to ascer

were begun at the bottom of the
crater, and a shaft was soon being
sunk.
There are about forty acres in the

Mr. Volz, the trader at Canyon Diab

Meteor Mountain for years, and has
been interested in the work of min
ing tor the meteorite. All the set
tlers in that part of the Southwest
believe that the main body of the
meteorite will be discovered at some
not distant day, and that science will
be immeasurably enriched, even if
the investigators do not find as
large a proportion of valuable car
bon as fragments have indicated.
If the main body of the meteorite
is located all other discoveries along
that line will be dwarfed. Science i3
always on the alert for meteoric dis
coveries. One of the most valuable
things brought back by Commander
Peary from his last trip of polar
discovery was a large meteorite,
which was sold for several thou
sand dollars. Fragments o varying
size and weight are picked up from
time to time, it being a theory gen
erally accepted that the average
meteorite bursts when it strikes the
belt of dense atmosphere surround
ing the earth. Generally this burst
ing is so thorough that the meteorite
i3 scattered into dust and sifts to
earth in that form. Only occasion
ally do larger fragments survive
In the case of the Arizona meteor
ite however, it would seem that the
falling body was so large that the
usual process of disintegration did
not take place when the dense at
mosphere of earth was struck. The
giant meteorite kept on falling in a
solid, blazing mass, until it was ex
tmguished in-the sands of the des
ert, hundreds of feet below the sur
face of the earth.

The Eskimos’ Sacred Secret
Dr. Andrews
Sometime in the far dim
past, a great mass of
metal hurtled down from
the dry and fell upon a
bleak island in Melville
Bay, Greenland. Today
this huge meteorite rests
peacefully in New York’s
Hayden Planetarium. Each
year thousands of persons
pass by it —but few of
them know anything 01 me near uageay mai
marked its journey from the North to its
present home.
When it fell to earth unknown centuries
ago, the heavenly visitor was' a real boon to
the ice-bound Eskimos, for they had no metal.
The meteorite gave what they needed roost —
iron for their spears and knives. Two other
meteorites — smaller ones —dropped six
miles away. One they called the “Woman”
for it resembled a woman sewing; the other
Thousands have seen this huge mass of metal,
but few know the strange adventure behind it

Noted Scientist and Explorer
was named the “Dog.” But the great one was
Ahnighito, the 'Tent.” According to their
superstition, the Innuit (Arctic Eskimo)
woman and her dog and tent were hurled
from the sky by Tomarsuk, the Spirit of
Darkness.
ThtyTsUPsury
Since time immemorial the Eskimos Juad
chipped off bits from the heavenly visitors,
and the location became a sacred secret of
the tribe. For well nigh a century explorers
had tried to find the place where the natives
got their metal, but the Eskimos refused to
tell. Then came Admiral Peary. Because of
his gifts — guns, knives, spears, needles, cloth
— they grew to love and trust him. By
unanimous consent he was guided to the
sacred spot and they agreed that he might
take the meteorites to the land below the ice
whence he had come.
Peary got the two small ones but, because
of its great weight, the ‘Tent” could not be
easily moved. Even today its exact weight is
not known, but is variously estimated at
somewhere between 36 and 65 tons. To drag
this huge mass trom its ice-bound bed was
a Herculean task. With hydraulic jacks,
Peary had it hoisted to a runway of timbers
and steel rails. But the great mass sank into
the wood and twisted the rails like match
sticks. A furious storm swept across Melville
Bay. The ship, the Hope, was threatened by
grinding ice and Peary had to sail away with
his mission incomplete.
The following summer (1897) he returned
with stronger planks, heavier rails and more
powerful jacks. Foot by foot, the monster
was dragged horn land across a bridge to the
ship, and lowered onto a bed of great oak
timbers in the hold. It settled resistlessly
into the wood, crushing the surface to splin
ters. Hurriedly the explorers braced it, for
bad weather was in the offing.
Out across Davis Strait they steamed
into the teeth of a furious storm. The tiny
vessel rolled and pitched dizzily. Time after
time she leaned and wavered, hesitated with
her rail under water.
Every moment the crew expected the
massive Ahnighito to break loose and crash
through the ship’s side. In that boiling in
ferno they never believed they would see
another day.
But by the grace of God and the stout oak
timbers, the meteorite never moved. In the
gray light of dawn they steamed under the
lea of Cape of God’s Mercy. As though
realizing the appropriateness of the name, all
of them knelt on the deck and offered thanks
to the One who gives life and takes it away.
METEORITE'S
""NEW
OWNER""
There is an amusing sequel to Dr. Andrews’
article. Robert R. Coles, chairman of the
Hayden Planetarium, tells this story:
Some years ago, when a Planetarium show
was about to start, a little boy’s frenzied
howls threatened to ruin the performance.
I hurried to the source of the disturbance.
The boy’s mother, I found, had refused to
buy him one of the small pieces of meteoric
iron for sale as souvenirs. The noisy protest
was almost raising our domed roof.
""Never mind.” I told him as soon as I
could make myself heard. ""I have something
much nicer for you.” I led him over to the
huge Peary meteorite. ""Here’s a whole one
- — from now on, this meteorite is yours.”
""Mine?” he asked. “You mean really
mine? Can I carry it home?”
“Absolutely,” I replied. “It’s yours to look
at, climb on, take care of and carry around in
your pocket, any time you wish.”
His eyes shone as he looked at his prize, and
we had no more trouble. Even today I see
this boy now and then, standing beside “his”
meteorite and showing it proudly to his
friends. Of course, I am wire he “got wise”
to me a long while ago. That’s why I feel free
to tell how that Planetarium performance
was saved. Up to now, it has been one of my
own “sacred secrets.” The End

SMITHSONIAN TAKING PART
American scientists, including some at the Smithsonian In*
stitution here, are now studying a fantastic meteorite which
fell near Bogou, Upper Volta, Africa, on August 14, 1962.
Weighing 19 pounds, the unique hunk of iron-nickle
is estimated to be 440 million years old, or three times as old
as the era in which dinosaurs were most prevalent. Detailed
investigations of its technical, metallurgical and radioactive
properties are expected to provide valuable information on
the meteorite’s history and origin in space as well as on space
itself. President Maurice Yameogo of Upper Volta has given
the United States permission to conduct the studies. Pre
liminary tests already confirm that the object’s radioactivity
was twice that of a fragment of a Soviet Sputnik which fell
at Manitowoc, Wis., a couple of years ago. This proves that
the meteor had been in deep space rather than in orbit near
the earth, scientists say. They hope for much more informa
tion.

W Xg f< ther«r i a ? possibility that death-dealing
visitors from interstellar space were responsible
for the mysterious disappearance of the tragic
list of transoceanic planes—Nungesser’s White
Bird, the Old Glory of Bertaud and Hill, the
Hon. wi*w> Mackay’s Endeavor, Mildred Doran’s
Honolulu-questing craft, the Sir John Carling,
and Roald Amundsen’s giant seaplane?
Did ""falling stars,” as the rank and file term
the metallic fragments with which the earth
constantly is being pelted, possibly account for
the loss of the French Zeppelin Dixmude, the
United States Navy collier Cyclops and the
r*»ni«h training ship Kobenhavn?
“Yes,” says Gen. Frederic Chapel, noted
French astronomer and meteorologist, who for
years has studied the phenomena of meteors
and meteorites.
""It is common knowledge among scientists,”
says Gen. Chapel, ""that from 70 to 4,000
meteorites plunge each year to our earth. If
we could check accurately how many fall
into waste stretches of the great oceans, un
observed, the number undoubtedly would
reach a much higher figure. Is it not possible
some of the missing sky and sea craft were
wiped out by these aerial visitors?”
The French expert goes further. He asserts
numerous mysterious explosions on land,
fOrest fires, even bad weather, may be due to
the whizzing fragments coming to us from
disintegrating planets untold millions of miles
distant.
«D ED-HOT meteorites,"" asserts this noted
*' Frenchman, ""literally sizzle through
•pace. It is entirely probable their passage
sets up electrical disturbances in the compara
tively thin envelope of atmosphere surrounding
our earth. Such disturbances may cause
atmospheric changes and attendant bad
weather.
“As for the power of meteorites, regardless of
size, to destroy earthly objects they may strike.
It has been calculated that a meteorite weigh
ing but 2 ounces possesses the potential force
of a 500-ton train as it strikes the terrestial
sphere at a speed as high as SO or 40 miles
per second.”
Have there been instances, one asks, of
meteorites killing persons or damaging
buildings?
There have. Only a few months ago an
18-year-old Hungarian girl of a farming
district near Budapest left her home one
starlit night to attend a wedding taking place
cm a neighboring estate. Eyewitnesses to the
tragedy described what happened. A ""falling
star” screamed in a wide parabola to earth.
It struck the road at a point where, a moment
before, the girl had been observed walking.
Her mangled body was found sprawled in the
dust. Beared fragments of a metallic sub
stance were scattered about, later being identi
fied as meteoritic matter.
In 1817 a falling meteorite partially wrecked
a house in the Strathmore district of Scotland.
Residents believed at first they had been the
target of a raiding German Zeppelin. Then
tests were made and the metal fragments were
revealed as pieces of a meteorite. History
records a similar incident in 1847, when a house
In Braunau, Bohemia, was shattered by a
""falling star,” which came to rest on a bed
to which three small children were sleeping.
Three years ago what unquestionably was a
giant meteorite fell in a densely wooded
district of Western Siberia. It exploded upon
landing, the detonation being heard many
miles. Investigators found a smoking area 3
miles wide and 7 in length from which every
vestige of trees had been wiped away.
Meteoritic fragments were found all about.

ago and vanished completely, is one of the greatest sea mysteries
According to the noted French astrono
mer, Gen. Chapel, it is quite probable
that some of the many planes which
have mysteriously disappeared, owe
their sad fate to an encounter with a
meteorite.
Arizona, known to many by the prosaic name
of Coon Butte, which scientists are convinced
marks the resting place of probably the largest
meteorite ever falling in the United States, If
not on the whole earth. It is a vast basin
4,000 feet across, 550 feet deep at its center
and surrounded by a limestone “lip” 100 feet

above the surrounding plain. Meteorite frag
ments have been found all about, and it is
believed the mother mass of metal lies buried
beneath.
Borings have failed to locate the mammoth
meteorite, but pictures taken from the air
indicate the great missile struck at an angle
and may lie some distance to one side of the
actual crater ring.
QOMDB. ROBERT E. PEARY, returning
from one of his polar expeditions, brought
back three meteorites, the largest of which
weighs 37*4 tons. Among the Eskimos of
Melville Bay, Northern Greenland, It was
known as “Ahnighito” (the Tent). The two
others were known as the Woman and the
Dog. For years natives had been chipping
off pieces of them from which to construct
their knives. According to the tale handed
down from their forefathers, evil spirits had
cast the great masses down from the heavens.
Peary brought the three meteorites to New
York. The Tent now rests beneath the en
trance arch of the Museum of Natural History.
Another famous meteorite, the Bacuibulto, so
called from the town in the State of Sinaloa,
Mexico, near which it fell, is estimated to
weigh in the neighborhood of 80 tons. This
weight is only approximate, as the great clot
of fused iron and quarts never has been raised
from its resting place.
Did a giant Interstellar fragment, such as
those mentioned, destroy the United States
Navy collier Cyclops?
The Cyclops, a vessel of 18,360 tons and by
reason of its construction capable of delivering
coal to a warship at sea at a rate of 1,440 tons
per hour, left the Barbados on March 3, 1818,
bound for Norfolk. Bhe carried a cargo of
manganese, and was commanded by Lieut.
Comdr. George W. Worley. Her personnel con
sisted of 18 officers, 221 men and 87 pas
sengers, many of the latter Navy officers and
men returning home for assignment.
After she cleared the islands nothing further
was heard of her. Not a body, not a particle
of wreckage ever was found. She carried one
of the most powerful wireless outfits in the
Navy. Had she run into a storm or been
mined or torpedoed, as many suggested, it
seems almost impossible she could have sunk
without some sort of 8O S being flashed. Yet
there was no distress call of any kind. After
the war the Germans denied all knowledge of
her fate, apparently shattering the mine and
torpedo theories. Was It a meteorite that erased
her from the face of the Atlantic.
/""VN December 18, 1923, the French airship
Dixmude left her hangar at Cuers bound
for a cruise to the north coast of Africa, under
the command of Lieut, du Pleas is de Grenadan.
She carried a crew of 50. Gales sprang up
when she arrived over Africa. She was unable
to land, due to lack of ground crews and
hangar accommodations.
The Dixmude. formerly the German Zeppe
lin Nordstem, was last heard by wireless on
he night of December 21, when, southwest of
'.Houggourt, Algeria, she flashed the statement
she was returning to Cuers. The following'''*
night persons fca Sicily reported seeing two
great balls of fire slowly descend into the
Mediterranean—""like a pair of balloons
on ftre.”
Two days later Sicilian fishermen, raising
their nets off Cape San Marco, found a French
naval officer’s body. It was Lieut, du Plessis.
Next day they found an empty gasoline tank,
later identified as belonging to the Dixmude;
a mass of tangled wires believed to be part
of the airship’s radio, and several burned frag
ments of rubberised balloon doth and scorched
human flesh. Nothing more was recovered.
The Dixmude was recorded as having been
destroyed by lightning. That guess may havg
been wrong. It may have been a meteorite.
AN December 14, 1928, the Danish training
ship Kobenhavn, owned by the Eastern
Asiatic Co. and manned by sailors and cadets to
the number of 50, sailed from Montevideo on an
8,000-mile voyage to Melbourne. She was A
trim, five-masted bark, with a steel hull, an
auxiliary power plant and a modern, powerful
wireless.
From the time she cleared Montevideo no call
was picked up from her. She sailed silently,
mysteriously, into oblivion. In June of last
year her owners sent the steamship Mexico on
a search for the lost vessel. The Mexico
combed the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans,
visiting Tristan de Cunha and the treacherous
Avocet Rock, on whose hidden reefs He the
bones of many gallant ships. Not a trace
of the Kobenhavn was found. A storm could
have wrecked her; a rock might have ripped out
her bottom. But why were there no distress
signals? Perhaps a “falling star” suit her,
crushed and shapeless, to the bottom in the
wink of an eye.
An interesting theory on the fate of tbs
Kobenhavn has recently been advanced by
waterfront seers in Copenhagen, who ascribe
the disappearance of the training ship to the
fact that some of the 48 cadets aboard had
captured an albatross before the ship cleared
for South America. They draw a dose
parallel between this modern ship and the one
which figured in Coleridge’S “Rime of the
;*-• Ancient Mariner.” "" *

The meteorite
This Land of Ours
Fragment From
Another World
By JESSE GREEN
IN 1941 JESSE DAY (deceased)
found a heavy rock in the vi
cinity of Lombard. Knowing that
George Shaw was a student of
minerals, the specimen was
brought to Shaw's shoe shop in
Bozeman. Further investigation
proved it to be a meteorite, and
Mr. Shaw obtained possession of
it. Recently arrangements have
been made to send the meteorite
to the museum of the School of
Mines at Butte.
Meteorites are of two kinds—
the stony and the iron varieties.
This one is an iron meteorite,
with a density about three times
that of other rocks, and having
the appearance of iron. It weighs
15 pounds and is composed of an
alloy of iron and nickel. As
shown in the photograph, one end
has been sawed off for analyses.
Stony meteorites are only about
one and one-half times as heavy
as other rocks. They are com
posed of stony or silicious ma
terial with inclusions of the iron
nickel alloy.
Many meteorites have fallen on
the thousands of square miles in
Montana, but this is the only one
that has been identified. These
bodies from other worlds are
constantly coming »to our earth.
Only rarely is one ablte to pene
trate the atmosphere without be
ing burned. What we call shoot
ing stars are these burning
meteorites.
Some large ones have hit the
earth, most notable of which was
the one that made the meteor
crater in Arizona. Another, of
modern times, fell in Siberia in
1908, making many small craters,
and burning several hundred
square miles of forest, A recent
announcement tells of the finding
of a crater in Northern Quebec
of over two miles in diameter.
As time goes on many meteo
rites will be found in Montana
and perhaps some craters.

Know Your Smithsonian
By JERRY O’LEARY, Jr.
Star Staff Writer
Editor’s note: The Smithsonian institution is one of the world’s greatest treasure
houses of Man’s study of the world in which he lives. This is the fourth in a senes of
articles about Washington’s famous museum.
THE NATIONAL MUSEUM has one of
the world’s leading collections of iron
and stone meteorites, those giant fragments
which come hurtling into the earth’s at
mosphere every day, but only a few are on
display.
Mankind is fortunate, indeed, that the
earth’s atmosphere and the friction of
speed burn most meteorites into destruction
before they reach the ground.
The largest specimen in the collection
is an iron meteorite from Goose Lake, Calif.,
which weighs 2,570 pounds. There Is a ring
meteorite—shaped like a gigantic school
ring—from Tucson, Ariz.
The most impressive display (shown
above) is the Bacubirito meteorite, cast in
plaster because it still lies in the mountain
ous Mexican state of Sinaloa, where it was
found. This meteorite is the second largest
ever discovered intact by man. It stands
11 feet 4 inches by 7 feet SVt inches by 3
feet 4 inches, dwarfing the girl in the
picture.
The Smithsonian’s collection of rocks,
stones, minerals and quartzes are fantastic
in size. These are the materials bearing
upon the history and composition of the
earth. Here are stalagmites and stalactites
from caverns; sinters from the hot springs
and geysers of Yellowstone National Park;
basaltic columns; giant potholes and other
examples of the work of the great glaciers.
Polished and etched surfaces are shown
in specially lighted cases.
Here also are the petrified logs to be
seen in the ancient fossil forests of Arizona
and the many forms of plant life which
contributed to the giant coal beds in the
United States.

Meteor Chips
Yield Clue to
Life in Space
NEW YORK, Mar. 17 (AP).—
A meteorite wjhich fell to earth
in France 97 years ago contains i
clues that some form of life
exists in outer space, it was re- ■
ported yesterday at a meeting
of the New York Academy of
Sciences.
Chips of the meteorite, which !
fell near Orgueil on May 14,
1864. are said to show a high
content of organic carbon, a
raw material of life.
Traces of wax-like substances
were found in the meteorite,
the scientists said, noting that
the substances had their origin
in living matter. Other hydro
carbons similar to those found
in plants and animals also were
detected, they added.
When the meteor exploded it
came down in about 20 pieces—
one as large as a man’s head
and most the size of a fist.
Tiny Portion Used
Chips from one fragment were
obtained from the American
Museum of Natural History in
New York by Dr. Bartholomew
Nagy, 34-year-old Hungarian
born professor of chemistry at
Fordham University.
Dr. Nagy and Dr. Douglas
J. Hennessy, another Fordham
chemistry professor, and Dr.
Warren O. Melnschein of Esso
Research and Engineering Co.,
made the discovery.
They worked on chips that
weighed a total of 10 grams—
roughly one-fiftieth of a pound.
Now they would like to make
similar analyses of other parts
jof the meteorite, and of other
! meterorites, to see if the in
formation checks.
Believe Something Lived
The three men told the meet
ing they had documentation to
confirm that their samples
came from a meteorite. And
other evidence, they said, in-

Harvard’s Famous Cabinet of Meteorites — How a Meteorite May
Be Worth Its Weight in Gold— Comparative Values and What
They Depend on —Curious Analogies With Terrestrial
Rocks
Boston, Nov. 3.—ls any one is so
luoky^ as to find one of the ""shooting
stars n hich will fall in the meteoric
showers due the 13th and 14th of this
month, he may congratulate himself on
having captured a prize worth its
weight in gold. The number of collect
ors of meteorites is increasing, and the
competition between the different cab
inets, public and private, has caused a
great advance in the price of rare spec
imens.
The largest and finest collection of
meteorites on this side of the Atlan
tic is the one in the Harvard Mineral
ogical Museum in Cambridge. Reckon
*Jl?. Eura P ean collections it ranks about
hl th or sixth in the world.. The British
Museum has the best collection, as it
has of so many other things, and the
cabinets of Vienna and Paris rank
next. The principal part of ^he Har
vard collection was brought together by
one of the most distinguished of Ameri
can chemists, the late J. Lawrence
Smith of Louisville. Ky., whose speci
mens were purchased by subscription in
1883, Prof. Smith, himself, being one of
the subscribers.
Calculating the comparative value of
collections of meteorites is something
of an art, however. A main point to
be taken into consideration is the num
ber of “falls,” so-called which are rep
resentad. Ordinarily, perhaps, each
meteoric mass which is found repre
sents a separate fall; but often a me
teorite splits into several pieces, falling
50 or 100 miles’ distant from one anoth
er, on striking the earth’s atmosphere.
The common origin of such pieces is
often demonstrated by analysis or by
general appearance, but more often,
perhaps, it remains in doubt.
About 275 Palls are represented^ at
Harvard, with a total weight—another
factor in estimating comparative val
ue—of fab out 2800 pounds. The largest
meteorite known is the famous one dis
covered by Peary in Greenland. The
largest meteorite in the Cambridge
collection weighs 1100 pounds. But the
largest meteorite is not necessarily the
most valuable. Much depends on the
matter of “control.” A very large and
famous meteorite is Canon Diablo, so
called, in accordance with the recog
nized rule for naming meteorites, from
the locality in Arizona where it was
found. Here great pieces of a thousand
pounds or more can be obtained by any
one who wants them for the trouble
and expense of carting them away. In
other words, no one “controls” it, and
it has little or no money value. On the
other hand, a much smaller and less in
teresting meteorite owned wholly or
mainly by a single cabinet is likely to
be worth hundreds of dollars. A single
swall piece of some notable meteorite
thus held mag easily bring, for example
at the rate or $75 to SIOO a pound. The
pound indeed is much too clumsy a
standard for so valuable a material as
meteoric stone or iron, and the weight
of all specimens is recorded in the cata
logue in grams.
A munaem needs only to keep the
bulk piece of a meteorite to retain con
trol of it. Other pieces it exchanges
with other collectors with a view to in
creasing its representation of falls. It
is interesting to note how carefully the
weight and distribution of these various
pieces’ are set down in museum records.
One of the most celebrated meteorites
in the Harvard Museum is Cynthiania,
found in the township of that name in
Harrison County. Ky. It weighed, when
found, about 6000 grams, of which 4772
grams are “provable”—that is, can be
assigned to different collections in var-

ious* weights. Of this amount, the two
largest pieces, weighing 3113 and 539
grams respectively, are retained by the
university, while other pieces, from a
single gram to upward of 400, are held
for exchange. When control is thus re
tained, the museum is able to count the
meteorite as one of its* “specialties.”
Harvard reckons 23 such specialties in
its collection,— controls, that is, the
largest and most representative pieces
of 23 separate meteorites.
In ancient times and among savage
tribes meteorites have always been
looked upon with more or less awe, and
have often been objects ,of worship. The
Palladium which fell at Troy, for ex
ample, was doubtless a meteorite. In
three ®mall meteorites discovered by
the Peabody Museum on altars raised
by the mound builders of the Little
Miami Valley In Ohio, Harvard pos
sesses the only authentic prehistoric ex
amples known to exist. Such archaeol
ogical or historical interest naturally
add® much to the market value of a
meteorite. A well-known American
collector recently secured from the
Shah of Persia u. number of pieces from
a famous semi-sacred meteorite which
had been in the possession of the royal
family for generations, and by dispos
ing of bits to various European muse
ums on his way home, was able, he
said, to pay all expenses of his trip to
Teheran.
Tho Harvard collection is catalogued
according to date of supposed fall, al
though it is admitted that these*dates
are often very uncertain. As the au
thor of the catalogue says, ""the con
nection between the fire ball which at
tracted attention and the meteorite sub
sequently found is often only assumed
and not established.” A meteorite,
however, is more valuable if seen to
fall. Next to the prehistoric Ohio
specimens, the earliest falls represented
at Cambridge are three dating back to
1164, two in Saxony and one in Bohe
mia. One each is ascribed to the 14th,
15th, and 16th centuries and 18. to the
18th, The earliest Amtyican fall re
corded is Cam no del Cielo, from the
Argentine Republic. 1783; and the first
in the United States, is the Weston,
Ct., 1807.
Not every specimen offered to the col
lector of meteorites is genuine; indeed,
mistakes are common. Not long ago an
old farmer wrote to the Harvard Mus
eum stating that whence was a boy,
in IS4O, he had seen a sooting star fall
in the field back of his house; this he
had now dug up, and he was ready to
receive an offer for it from the museum}
On examination the supposed meteorite
proved to a common boulder, which
had lain in the old man’s field for 20,-
000 years, more or less. It is oftentimes
a very difficult thing to locate the exact
spot where a meteorite falls. The blind
ing light, the whole startling nature of
the phenomenon, will often cause an
observer to think that it has fallen close
at hand, when in reality tt^e distance
may be as much as 25 or even 50 miles.
Meteorite® are either of stone, or of
iron mixed with nickel. Before the lat
ter are put on exhibition they are us
ually cut in two to show a polished sur
face, which is etched with acid to bring
out the variety of the structure. Cer
tain meteorites thus treated show what
are called Widmanstaettian figures—a
form of crystallization of great beauty
which is found in terrestrial iron, and
then Imperfectly, only in specimens
from Disco Island, Greenland, where a
mass of basalt has flowed up from the
interior of the earth.
. Meteorites, of. course, are the only
physical evidences we have of the com

our own. Their general scientific in-

""In the sutiimer and fall of ’9B, while in the Indian Territory, that being a malarial
country, I had fever and ague all the time till I became all run-down,” writes Mr. L.
Cameron, of Parvin, Denton County, Texas. ""During my chilling I took catarrh of
the head and it troubled me a great deal. Then I had bronchitis. Had two doctors
with me and got some better, and in January, 1899, I moved from the Indian Territory
to Arkansas. Being exposed by traveling in very cold weather I grew worse. I had
two of the very best doctors I could get, but still grew worse. Was alivised by a friend
to try Dr. Pierce’s Golden Medical Discovery, so I commenced taking it. The doctors
could do me no good, quit coming to see me and said I would die. The people said I
had consumption and could not live. I took the ' Golden Medical Discovery ’ accord
ing to directions. For two weeks I could not talk above a whisppr, and for four weeks
I had to lie on my left side all the time. I could not eat a bit of anything. All the
nourishment I could take was a little sweet milk with whiskey or brandy hi it to keep
me from vomiting. After I had taken two or three bottles of ‘ Golden Medical Discov
ery ’ I began to mend. For forty-seven days I could not get out of the house. I kept
on taking the ‘ Discovery ’ until I had taken twelve bottles, and I am now well and do
not cough any at all. I believe Dr. Pierce’s Golden Medical Discovery saved my life.
""I feel very thankful to you for preparing such a valuable remedy, and thankful to
God for the existence of such an Institution as the one with which you are connected.
""I desire to have this published, in order that people who are afflicted as I was 1 with
that terrible disease (bronchitis) may read my statement and be induced to take your
medicines and perhaps be saved from a consumptive’s grave.”
•• After having followed your advice for three months longer (from the day
of writing you), I feel that I have been amply repaid,” writes Mr. Clarence Payne,
of Washington, D. C., 1328 N. H. Avenue, N. W. ""When I received your advice I
was suffering greatly. Pains in my chest, sides and under shoulder-blades, spitting
blood, particles, and a quantity of mucous matter (stringing as it left my mouth).
The doctor pronounced my case bronchitis, and a specialist said I had laryngitis and
advised me to go to the mountains ; but I came into possession of one of your books,
and after following your advice I am proud to say that I have gained between fifteen
and twenty pounds. I took in all seven bottles of (Golden Medical Discovery ’ and
two vials of Dr. Pierce’s Pellets. lam still using your-medicine, now as a tonic.”
terest is that they probably represent
the composition of the interior of our
earth. Although in Greenland iron is
the only terrestrial iron resembling true
meteoric iron, the crust’of the earth
contains rocks very similar to both the
stone and the iron meteorites, with the
exception that the meteoric iron is
represented by some form of oxidiza
tion of iron. The oxidization has taken
place, of course, in th(* passage of these
rocks upward through the earth’s <;rust.
Another analogy is drawn from the
connection between iron and diamonds.
In South Africa diamonds appear in a
rock much like an iron meteorite, with
the distinction of oxidization; and the
first successful production of artificial
diamonds, was from the cooling of
melted iron under pressure. Add to
these facts, one more,—that the Canon
Diablo meteorite has been found to
contain microscopic diamonds,—and it
will be seen how interesting a compari
son of terrestrial and celestial min
eralogy may become.

Deafness Cannot Be Cured

There Is only one way to cure deafness,
and that Is by constitutional remedies.
Deafness Is caused by an Inhumed condi

elan tube. When this tube Is Inflamed
you have a rumbling sound or Imperfect

deafness is the result, and unless the In

tube restored to Its normal condition,
hearing will be destroyed forever; nine
cases out of ten tiro caused by catarrh,
which Is nothing but an Inflamed condi

Did you ever hear the history of the
girls’ club that was formed in our vil
lage several years ago? The tale is
a matter of discussion at many a fire
side, even ^o this day.
The idea that the girls thereabouts
were behind the times and ought to
unite fort improvement, was first sug
gested by a young woman who had
been visiting in the city, and had seen
the number of interests that took up the
time of her apparently briliant cousins.
The question of effecting an organiza
tion was proposed to a few girl friends
when the visitor returned to her home.
Invitations were sent out, and,< as uh*
ual, one or two girls were overlooked.
No amount of persuasion could make
them attend the first meeting, or, for
that matter, any meeting, afterward.
The fact that these girls had been for
gotten in the first place was n^ver for
given by them. They constituted the
club’s earliest enemies.
Much enthusiasm was shown at the
first meeting, and officers, were elected.
But among them, not one of the orig
inators of the movement was chosen.
At the second meeting these senders
of invitations were not present. They
had not been elected to office, and they
never appeared again at the club
rooms.
The assembly prospered for a few

T. A PETERSON CO.’ 6 ’i""
The Child is el me Man.
It shocks us when we pick up the newspaper and see the name of an old schoolmate
associated with crime. As we picture him behind the bars there, rises before us the
vision of the bright scholar and merry playmate, and it seems impossible that this boy
can have ended his career in a felon’s cell. There’s another sad experience which
comes to ^us. We chance on a weak, emaciated form, being pushed alohg in an
invalid’s chair. There is something familiar about the man’’, face. There’s recogni
tion in his eye. We take the thin, transparent hand and look enquiringly. It can't'
be he ! What! Harry Smith, the college athlete ? This poor, gasping wreck the one !
time hero of the diamond and gridiron ? ButZio it is And again; memory flies' back
to the old days of school and we see this frail man as he was —magnificent in brawn,
and sinew, superb in health.
What can we do for these unfortunates—the criminal and consumptive ?
For the criminal we can do little. For the consumptive much. We can point him
to a great army of men an,d women who were in like case. They' were weak and
emaciated, coughing night and day. They had. hemorrhages and night-sweats.,
Medicine failed to help them. Doctors gave them up. Then someone said try 1
Dr. Pierce’s Golden Medical Discovery. It looked like the straw which the drowning
man clutches. It proved to be a life buoy.
In the other column are given some specimen statements by those who have been
cured by' the use of ""Golden Medical Discovery.” ""Condemned but reprieved.”
These are fairly representative statements. They are only two out of thousands.
It is natural to ask, ""How can these things be?” How can Dr. Pierce's GdMcn
Medical Discovery cure when doctors pronounce the case hopeless and all atber.«Deaos
and methods have utterly failed ? That question deserves an honest answer.
Think a moment. Did you ever know of a fleshy, well-nourished mon dying of
consumption ? The question itself seems absurd. Consumption is a wasting disease. ,
The sign, manual of consumption is emaciation.
Then it seems evident that the principal feature of the disease is lack of nutrition.:
If the body could be nourished and increased in flesh, the disease,would lose its hold.
All treatments of consumption recognize this chief factor of nourishment. Nausea
ting oils and their scarcely more palatable emulsions are administered as body-building
foods, easy of assimilation. The appetite is poor. The stomach is weak. The
administration of oil is an attempt to slip food past a weak stomach. As far as it,
goes.the oil is good. But it does not go far enough, because it does nothing for the'
health of the stomach, and the stomach is the vital center of the whole physiari
organism. No man can be stronger than his stomach. Weak stomach means weak
man.
Now suppose a medicine that began by curing the diseases of the stomach and other
organs of digestion and nutrition. When this is done the appetite increases. The
food eaten is properly digested and perfectly assimilated and is converted into nutrition
which in the form of blood builds up every organ of the body.
That is just the work done by ""Golden Medical Discovery.” It makes new blood
and new flesh and so new life. What’s the bdfet test of the progress of consumption?
The scales. Every day will show a loss of weight as emaciation progresses. What’s
the best test of the. progress of the cure by "" Discovery ? ” Again the scales. If the
weight increases. If flesh is being formed and the body filled out the ""Discovery ” has
called "" Halt ! ” to the disease.
It is the common experience that the cures effected by the use of ""Golden Medical
Discovery ” are marked by gains of sound, solid flesh. These gains speak for them
selves. For as surely as the downward progress is marked by loss of flesh, so surely
gain of flesh must indicate a gain of health. i
Dr. Pierce’s Golden Medical Discovery cures obstinate, deep-seated coughs; bron-'
chitis, bleeding of the lungs, and other forms of disease which if neglected or unskill
fully treated find a fatal termination in consumption. J
COMMON SENSE applied to hygiene and medicine, aptly describes Dr. Pierce’s 1
great work, The People’s Common Sense Medical Adviser, 1008 pages, which is sent free on receipt
of stamps to pay expense of mailing only.
""I thank you most sincerely for the Common Sense Medical Adviser,"" writes Mrs. Charles E.
Thompson, of Georgetown, Eldorado Co., Cal. It is a spiruditi book, and everything is made so
plain in it that anyone can understand. I would not part with mine for anything.""

months. Then new names were pre
sented for membership. According to
the constitution, Ineligible names were
to be blackballed. When the vote was
known, it was found that two of the
applicants had been rejected. The
members who proposed the rejected
names left the club.
Another month passed. It was voted
to present a drama, for charitable pur
poses. Books were bought, special
meetings were held and the time for a
definite distribution of parts arrived.
These were given, out as nearly as
possible to the girls most fit to. assume
the roles. But there were a few dis
satisfied members, and after some
wrangling, they ceased to 'appear at
rehearsals, and finally joined the num
ber who had resigned. The factions
outside ‘he club united In friendship
among themselves and took In the ori
ginal ""forgotten girls.” No 'opportuni
ty of making slighting remarks about
their former associates was Allowed to
pass, by the now recognized enemies of
the club.
The masculine element In the com
munity was highly amused at the tiffs
between the two bodies. But the club
was still active and the drama was
successfully presented In good season.
Then pame a time of prosperity. It
was voted to have a list of honorary
members. The list was made out and
the. honorary members were named.
Occasionally one of them would drop
Into the clubroom for a little chat. Of
aM the honorary members, two appear
ea most Interested in the workings of
the club and visited It frequently.
Gradually there came an almost Invis
ible split In the club, one set of girl?
chatting and laughing with one of the
visitors, while another set appeared
especially friendly to visitor number
two.
Little bits of gossip were retailed by
the different sides, and soon a clond of
distrust settled upon the chib. A girl
did not dare to spuaKtwwWjtc on tnat-
ters of business, and sometimes not
even then, lest she be misunderstood
or misquoted. The honorary members
gradually ceased to have an Interest in
the organization, and finally, even the
two who had drawn opposing sides as
followings, no longer appeared at meet
ings.
One by one the members realized
that they were living in an unwhole
some atmosphere of doubt and distrust-,
and resignations were handed In, till
the girls' club was a mere name, and
Its members hardly spoke to each
other. The organization disbanded.

higher forms, or strange shapes produced
by processes of evolution unknown to us
here? And what happened to that world?
Such things can be guessed at only.
As to what its life forms were, two
things seem reasonably sure. One Is that
they resembled in some degree those we
know on earth. This is indicated by tho
similarity of tl?c crinoid fossils to our own
crinoid forms, and by the presenco of
water and oxygon showing that tho condi
tions were to somo extent like our own.
The other thing wo can believe with rea
sonable certainty is that while they re
sembled our forma In some respect they
differed widely in others, tor the condi
tions in which they underwent their long
evolutionary processes must havo been
""like in some ways, different in others.
The artist who has made the large draw
ing on this page gives you an idea of whnt
you might expect if you visited another of
these inhabited planets. You would prob
ably see forms which reminded you of
things you had seen on earth, vtft weirdly
and fantastically different, as in a night
mare or fairy-tale. You would almost cer
tainly see forms of life that resembled to
some extent our vegetables?living things
fastened by their roots?and living things
with power of locomotion that would re
mind you in a fantastic way of our own
animals. Yon might or mig t not need the
helmets and oxygen tanks which the artist
lias provided his men in tho drawing?de
pending on whether tho atmosphere was
like our own or different from it. Soma
kind of atmosphere there would have to
be. else there could be 110 life. The exact
detail, of course, is purely imaginative.
The most extraordinary and most dis
cussed single meteorite that ever came to
earth is the famous ""Knyahlnya""?so called
from the name of the Hungarian town near
where it fell. It Is also known as tho Hahn
meteor, because of the exhaustive study
of it made by Dr. Otto Hahn, geologist and
physicist of the University of Vienna. Ac
cording to bis views and those of other
German scientific men. this meteorito watt
largely composed of fossil animals and
plants. This, of course, was in a past gen

Solving Secrets of Shooting Stars
BY JAMES STOKI.EY.
—« LASHES of light in tranquil Sum
m . mer skies. ... “A shooting star,”
you say. A meteor, dead fragment
M ' of a star has burned itself out in
the earth’s atmosphere, like a spark
thrown off by a passing locomotive.
But some day there may be the roar at
a express trains as a massive chunk
of sky dust projects itself out of the heavens
and in the middle of a great city.
True, practically all the large meteors that
have scarred the earth’s surface during the
memory of man have landed in comparatively
remote and sparsely settled parts of the globe.
Yet due to the earths constant revolving,
these destructive bodies might have landed
in the heart of some world metropolis if they
had fallen Just a short time sooner or later.
More interesting than worldly disaster, how
ever, Is the hint that these meteors are frag
ments of other solar systems, other groups of
planets surrounding the stars of the sky.
A few months ago there was discovered la
South Africa a huge meteorite. So far, its
size can only be estimated, as it is still al
most entirely buried in the earth. However.
Dr. W. J. Luyten, stationed at the Harvard
College Observatory’s South African branch,
has estimated it at 50 tons.
In the American Museum of Natural His
tory. in New York City, is the famous Ahnighito
meteorite, which weighs 36 '-i tons. Until the
discovery in South Africa this was the largest
meteorite known. * ' *
In a museum in Stockholm is another huge
meteorite. It was discovered in Greenland in
I*7o by the Swedish explorer A. E. Norden
sktold. It weighs 21 tons.
T»UT even these huge stones are small com
pared to two other famous falls. On June
30, 1908, at 7 o’clock in the morning in the
Yenisei Province of Siberia a meteorite, or
“falling star,” was seen to land. Though this
is a comparatively sparsely settled region of
the globe, thousands of people saw it.' Still
more heard the thunderous roar that accom
panied its passage and the sound waves were
recorded on barographs at the towns of Kirensk
and Irkutsk. At Irkutsk, also, a seismograph,
used for recording earthquakes, registered the
vibration which it caused.
Nearly 20 years after this meteorite fell, a
group of Russian scientists succeeded in reach
ing the scene and studying it. They found the
country torn up for miles around, the trees of
the forests had been knocked over and lay on
the ground in tows, stripped of bark and
branches, with the tops pointing away from
the center of the meteor’s fall.
For miles farther the trees showed evidence
of a forest fire. Altogether, an area about 40
miles in diameter is affected. So far the me
teor itself has not been located. Probably it
is buried deeply in the ground and only at
the expense of much more labor can it be
found.
But even the Siberian meteorite is probably
smaller ♦-h*n the famous one that caused the
meteor crater in Arizona. Nobody knows when
this fell—perhaps it was thousands of years
ago. It formed a great crater, four-fifths of
a mile across the top and about 450 feet deep
below the surrounding plains.
Piled up around the outside is a rim of
quarts and rock fragments so that it has an
inside height of about 570 feet. A company
has been formed, and is now at work, trying
to locate the mass of iron of the meteor itself.

THE SUNDAY STAR. WASHINGTON. D. C, JULY 14, 7.
A message from space* Large meteorites on display in the National Museum . .
Scientists Now Have Concluded That These
Heavenly Messengers, Some Capable of
Wiping Out Whole Cities, Give Evidence
There Are Other Solar Systems and That
Possibly There Are Other Inhabited Planets.
So the scientist does not worry what damage
meteorites might do. Instead, be devotes his
time to studying them, finding what they are
made of, and learning their significance in the
srheme of the universe.
At the University of Pennsylvania is one of
the meteor authorities of the world. Prof.
Charles P. Olivier, author of the standard
work hi English on the subject of meteors. Re
cently be spoke before the Franklin Institute
In Philadelphia and told of his latest conclu
sions on the subject of shooting stars. Per
haps the most striking of these is that the
meteors which continually bombard the earth
are messengers to earth from other stellar sys
tems carrying the assurance that our sun and
its attendant planets are not alone among
such systems in the heavens.
Coming as unexpectedly as they do, exact
determination of the way a meteor is moving
is seldom possible. But under Prof. Olivier’s
direction there has been formed a very active
group of amateur scientists, known as the
American Meteor Society. Its members watch
particularly for the shooting stars, and re
port them to him—a valuable scientific service.
From a large number of such observations of
the paths they take it is possible to calculate
just the way they are moving and their speed.
Such work as this has shown that most of
the meteors are tnovlng in the curve known as
a hyperbola.
If you cut a slice out of a con?, you get
one of three kinds of curves, all of which are
grouped together under the general name of
“comic sections.” If you cut nearly perpen
dicular to the axis you get an ellipse. If the
cut is parallel to the side the curve is a para
bola. while if it is away from the side the
result is a hyperbola.
All of the heavenly bodies that belong to or
enter our solar system move in one of these
three curves. The planets themselves move in
ellipses; so do most of the known comets. A
few comets move in parabolas, but it turns
out that most of the meteors are moving in
hyperbolas.
This latter fact is more than a curious bit of
information, for only bodies originating in our
own solar system can move in ellipses. Motion
in a hyperbola proves that the body entered
the solar system from outer space, and so we
have evidence that the meteors are really visi
tors from some other pert of the universe.
But not all meteors are such visitors. Many
of them, especially those of the great showers,
such as the ones that occur in November and
August, do move in elliptical paths. This
shows that they are natives of the solar sys
tem and have been born in away similar to
the birth of the earth itself.
from their motion, the strange me
teors and those of our own family are
the same. And this brings us to the conclu
sion, as Prof. Olivier expresses it: ""That planets
also, not unlike our own, circulate about other
stars as well as these meteorites, which alone,
with an occasional comet, can escape from
their original home and bring this message
to us.”
So here is evidence, for the first time In
astronomical history, that our solar system is
not alone in creation. In a few months the
star Capella will appear in the constellation
of Auriga, the charioteer, in the northeastern
sky. This is a yellow star, the spectroscope
shows it to be similar in composition to the
sun. Perhaps surrounding Capella is a retinue
of planets. Presumably on one of these planets
conditions would be similar to what they are
on the planets of our own system.
It is conceivable that these planets might
also be inhabited, but the astronomer who now
has the first meager evidence that there are
other solar systems hesitat?s to express an
opinion.
The study of meteors has an interesting
history beginning with veneration, passing
through a stage of skeptical disbelief and
finally reaching the present scientific attitude
toward them.
The earliest records are of meteors falling
in China in the years 6*7 and 644 B.C. Dur
ing the following six centuries these annals
record 14 others. Various classical witters
mention them and that they were supposed
to be sacred.
In more recent years they fell in other parts
of the world and also were regarded as holy
objects. However, the oldest known meteorite
whose fall is actually recorded, dates from
1492, so that year has something to be famous
for besides Columbus’ discovery of America.
“Our very term ’meteorology' proves that for
a long time they were considered to be merely

is a probability that the meteorite fell
on the island of Oahu. G. M. Cooke
and four other saw the meteorite fall.
They were in a row boat at Walklkl
off shore from the John Ena road. A
bout 8 o'clock while looking 'toward
the east, they saw a ball of fire, about
the size of the full moon, suddenly
drop from the heavens. Evidently

locality of Kaimuki. The watchers In
the boat saw the thing distinctly,
through the foliage of Kapiolanl Park
as the ball descended. After the ob
ject apparently struck the ground
there was a glare for the space of a
few seconds after which the light Im
mediately went out.
Had the meteorite fallen Into the sea
on the other side of the Island the re
flection which was observed Just before
the light went out, would not have 'been
seen. In the opinion of Mr. Cooke the
meteorite must have fallen on this
island some where in the vicinity of
Kaimuki. He inquired of some of the
soldiers at Camp 'McKlnley if the
guards had not noticed the object fall
ing but none of the soldiers appeared
to have done so. Searching parties
are likely to visit the Kaimuki dis
trict and trv to find some trace of the
meteorite.

' ■ night bathing Is the latest'stunt to afford amusement to
novelty-bunting society folk. The dark figures splashed and the
sheen of the disturbed waters glistened in the moonlight Every*
thing was lovely until—— ’
Suddenly a blinding flash swept across the skies, lighting the
level beaches for one hundred miles so that they were like day.
A roaring meteorite, like a sun In itself, shot downward at furious
pace and vanished in the sea. Many of the bathers ran for the
palm trees, others fell face downward on the sands and covered
their eyes with their hands. It was the greatest thrill Florida’s
thrill-mad visitors ever experienced
This year saw the most brilliant season that Palm Beach and
the other southern resorts have ever known. The Riviera of
America provided novelties galore to entertain the wealthy folk
who ever demand new amusements to make days and nights delightful
There were jaza bands, gambling, dancing, motor racing, trapshooting,
radio on the beach, mah Jongg played on curious rafts In the water,
airptaning, hydroplaning and, finally, midnight bathing.
Midnight bathing was the season's after-dance novelty. When the
plaintive strains of the latest ""Mamma Loves Papa"" variation died out
there was a rush for bath-houses, a quick change to one-piece, skin-tight,
bathing suits, a race across the sands, a plunge into the cool
southern waters.
But this year Nature stepped In Just when the new nocturnal fes*
tlvljy was at its merriest. She splashed her gorgeous colors across the
gigantic canvas of the night sky and the splendor of it frightened—for a
moment—all human beings who saw it
The display lasted for about one minute. During that time the
meteorite raced like a furious god, with the speed of light, and it seemed
to the society folk as if it were coming straight at them. Then, as
it plunged headforemost into the silver sea, its tail gave a faintly
waning light
The next morning everyone was talking about It. On yacht club
porches and golf courses, in dining rooms and on the esplanade, it was:

NEW-YORK DAILY TRIBUNE. SUNDAY. JANUARY 21, 1906.
When the gigantic meteor fell hissing into
the earth; if it ever did so. the concussion must
have been terrific. And in this connection it is
interesting to note that the Indians near by have
a legend about a huge star falling <>ut <>f the
heavens and dazzling the tribe with its bright
ness. Tht'ii then- was a great shock and sud
den darkness, and ever since then the Indians
have regarded Meteorite Mountain with awe.
Some idea of the action of the meteorite can
be obtained by throwing a stone into the mud.
When the meteorite buried itself far into the
earth the sides woe heaved up, leaving a rim
iik< circle about ihe depression. As the meteorite
sank into the earth it must have crushed layers
i I r< ■! sandstone and limestone. It is believed
thai the white sand found in the crater and on
the sides of the mountain is from the sandstone
pulverized by the meteor in its descent. This
sand was blown skyward and afterward settled
down on the mountain, covering it thickly. No
sand like n is to be found near the mountain.
Men searching the ground surrounding the
mountain for a distance- of several miles find
small meteorites. Several of these weigh as
■ ich is one thousand pounds, and others weigh
• ■nly a fraction of an ounce. Thy largest
pieces were found furthest from the mountain.
These meteorites have been proved to be practi
cally non-magnetic. This may explain why the
immense body of iron in the buried meteor has
n<i shown any magnetic properties. Needles
taken to the mountain have not shown the pres
ence of any great magnetic attraction, and this
lad puzzled scientists, until it was found that
the fragments found near the mountain did not
possess magnetism.
Another interesting discovery is the presence
of what is called ""iron shale"" near the mountain.
These are fragments of burned or ""dead"" iron.
They might have been broken from the meteorite
at the time of the terrific impact, or they might
have been snapped from the- larger body owing
to a sudden cooling process. Inasmuch as the
Canyon Diablo country was at one time an im
mense inland sea, another interesting theory has
been brought forth— that the meteor fell into
this sea, and that the great number of splinters
of iron in the neighborhood were caused by the
sudden cooling of the molten mass. It has been
discovered that these small meteorites contain
diamonds.
The company that has been conducting the
work of excavation has found little so far In
the way of reward. When the shaft had reached
a depth of 195 feet a strong Mow of water was
found, and an engine had to be installed. Then
the drill stuck fast in white quicksand, and other
difficulties of similar nature have been encoun
tered, making the work slow. But there is no
intention of abandoning the enterprise, as the
men behind the scheme think there will be re
ward in plenty if they can only keep on untrl
they discover the huge meteorite and find dia
monds embedded in its surface.
BOOKS AID BRUSH.
Device of a Portrait Painter to Ob
tain Satisfactory Poses.
Paul Nauen, a Munich artist, who is visiting
this country and who was entertained the other
evening at the Salmagundi Club by those mem
bers who were his pupils, uses books to aid his
brush. While he paints a portrait he has an

attendant read some volume aloud. Tet not for
his own guidance; not to help him curve a line
or shade a color. The book instead is for his
sitter, to enliven one who has grown weary of a
long pose, or to awaken emotions whose effect
on the countenance he may desire to portray.
""You little realize how potently the printed
page can affect the human face until you watch
the features of a listener intently, as an artist
does from behind an easel."" said Air. Nauen.
""Of course, the book must suit the subject. Al
most always I suggest that the one I am paint
ing choose the author and the work. And fre
quently the choice takes me much by surprise.
A book will oftentimes uncover an unknown side
to a person's character. I was painting a comic
opera singer some time ago, and when I thought
tho posing had begun to tire her I suggested
that she might like to hear a book by Dumas.
I had judged her nature to be of that emotional,
ebullient kind which would best respond to
something like 'The Three Musketeers. ' But
she shook her head at me sadly and said:
"" 'No, no; don't let me hear Dumas. His Imoks
make me think of a part of my life I would for
get.' Then she told me she was to have mar
ried a young French officer, and that during his
courtship he had related to her the story of
D'Artagnan. 'But,' she added, 'a darker pair
of eyes stole him from me, so I want to hear no
more of love. Let me listen to some book like
""Treasure Island,"" which has nothing to do with
the frailty of a woman's heart.'
""""Well, sir,"" said the painter, ""it took several
sittings for her to recover again her oldtime
gayety.,
""An old bachelor who had sown his wild oats
in Paris and was still sowing them, without
seeming to reap any harvest except an exceed
ing ennui toward all the normal things of life,
once sat for me. It was in vain that I tried
to draw him out. Futile were my attempts to
arouse him and awaken in his face any anima
tion. The names of books were repeated to him
by the score, but none appealed to him. At last
I said, just for the nonsense of it:
•""Well, then, what would you say to ""The
Simple Life,"" by good Pastor Wagner?*
""For tho first time he started up. He was
indignant, but curious, too. He called Wag
ner many a hard name, but he wanted to hear
what the pastor had to say. And so he listened
to Tho Simple Life/ and as he listened I saw
his features first reflect cynicism, then suf
ferance, and last of all a gentle charity which
I seized on eagerly and transferred as rapidly
as I could to my canvajj. Wagner had broken
through the hard shell' of'thal artificial life and
had reached the heart within, and after aSfl «
was a r.endsr heart.

said Mr. Nauen, ""persisted In going to sleep. n«
matter what was read to her. I tried to taX
to her, but it was a double failure. Not onrj
did I become distracted by trying to do two
things at once, but it invariably made the
good old woman cry. She would always
return to the subject of death, not of herself
though she was not wir from the grave, but at
her only son, who had recently died hi the prime
of life. So for U-ir she either weej OF sleep 1
asked her to sit so I might ji;u:.r a side view

the picture with much difficulty when I chanced
to speak cif a German translation ""f Bryant's

minute i spoke of the r m, however, I chlded
myself. ""What a blunder,' I said to myself.
'That will start h* r to crying ak':iin.'
'■ Y» s, yes; 1 she exclaimed, before I rould
change the subject, 'I have always wanted to
read ""Thanatopsis,"" but never came aCTOBB a
translation of it into German You must get
me the translation you have and let me hc;ir it.'
And so I did, and to my surprise the old woman
ceased to we*-j>, but sat and listened i
sweet resignation. It seemed to soothe her con-
pletely. She heard it over and over again. H
was an inspiration to me as well. I painted her
in a sort of twilight, and called the picture

SHOOTING STARS
Harvard’s Famous Cabinet of
Meteorites—Curious Analo
gies With Terrestial Rocks
Boston, November 4.—If any one is so
lucky as to find one of the ‘‘shooting stars”
which will fall in the meteoric showers duo
the 13th and 14th of this month he may
congratulate himself on having captured
a prize worth its weight in gold. The num
ber of collectors of meteorites is increasing,
and the competition between the different
cabinets, public and private, has caused a
great advance in the price of rare speci
mens.
The largest and finest collection of me
teorites on this side of the Atlantic is the
one in the Harvard Mineralogical Museum
In Cambridge. Reckoning European collec
tions, it ranks about fifth or sixth in the
World. The British Museum has the be3t
collection, as it has so many other things,
and the cabinets in Vienna and Paris rank
next. The principal part of the Harvard
Collection was brought together by one or
the most distinguished of American cheir
ists, the late J. Lawrence Smith of Louis
ville, Ky., whose specimens were purchased
by subscription in 1&&, Professor Smith
himseli being one of the subscribers.
Calculating the comparative value of col
lections of meteorites is something of an
art, however. A main point to be taken in
to consideration is the number of ‘ tails,”
so-culled, which are represented. Ordina
rily, perhaps, each meteoric mass which is
found represents a separate fall; but often
a meteorite splits into several pieces, fall
ing fifty or one hundred miles distant from
one another, on striking the earth's atmos
phere. The common origin of such pieces
is often demonstrated by analysis or by
general appearance, but more often, per
haps, it remains in doubt.
auuui -io iu.ua cii c i cpicBcuwru ai x 1 ai -
vard, with a total in weight—another factor
in estimating comparative value—of about
2800 pounds. The largest meteorite known
is the famous one discovered by Peary In
Greenland. The largest meteorite in the
Cambridge collection weighs 1100 pounds.
But the largest meteorite is not necessarily
the most valuable. Much depends on the
matter of “control.” A very large and fa
mous meteorite is Canon Diablo, so called,
in accordance with the recognized rule tor
naming meteorites, from the locality in Ar
izona where it was found. Here great
pieces of a thousand pounds or more can
be obtained by any one who wants them
for the trouble and expense of carting them
away. In other w'ords, no one ""controls”
it, and it has little or no money value. On
the other hand, a much smaller and less
interesting meteorite owned wholly or
mainly by a single cabinet is liable to be
w'orth hundreds of dollars. A single small
piece of some notable meteorite thus held
may easily bring, for Aimple, at the rate
of $75 or $100 a pound. The pound Indeed Is
much too clumsy a standard for so valuable
a material as meteoric stone or iron, and
the weight of all specimens is recorded In
the catalogues In grams.
A museum needs only to keep the bulk
piece of a meteorite to retain control of it.
Other pieces It exchanges with other col
lectors with a view to increasing Its repre
sentation of falls. It is Interesting to note
how carefully the weight and distribution
of these various pieces are set dowW ..tap
museum records. One ofUjw most
brated meteorites in th^-jfervmrd Museum
Is Oyrrfhianla. found In the township of
that nnmp in Iiarrlson County, Kentucky.
It weighed, when found, about $000 grams,
«|772 grams are “pfovable”—that
assigned to different collect!
weights. Of this amount tin two
ces. weighing 8113 mid 530 grams I
y. ar^ retahiifPby the Universl
>ther places, from a single gram
s of fun, are held for exchange.
tifax Is thus retained, the museum
Is ftVPTb count the meteorite as one of its
“specialties.” Harvard reckons twenty
three such specialties In its collection—
controls, that is. the largest and most rep- 1
resen tatlve pieces of twenty-three separate
meteorites.
Tn ancient times and among savage tribes
meteorites have always been looked upon
with more or less awe, and have often been
objects of worship. The Palladium which
fell at Troy, for example, was doubtless a
meteorite. In three small meteorites dis
covered by the Peabody Museum on altars
raised by the mound builders of the Little
Miami Valley In Ohio, Harvard possesses
the only authentic prehistoric examples
known to exist. Such archaeological or his
torical Interest naturally adds much to the
market value of a meteorite. A well-known
American collector pecently secured from
the Shah of Persia a number of pieces
from a famous semi-sacred meteorite which
had been In the possession of the royal
family for generations, and by disposing of
bits to various European museums on his
way home, was able, he said, to pay all the
expenses of his trip to Teheran.
I ne Harvard collection Is catalogued ac
cording to date of supposed fall, although
it is admitted that these dates are often
Very uncertain As the author of the cata
logue says, ""the connection between the
fire-ball which attracted attention and the
meteorite subsequently found If often only
assumed, and not established."" A meteor
ite, however, is more valuable if seen to
fall. Next to the prehistoric Ohio speci
mens, the earliest falls represented at
Cambridge, are three dating back to 11GI,
two In Saxony and one in Bohemia. One
each is ascribed to the fourteenth, fifteenth
and sixteen centuries and eighteen to the
eighteenth The earliest American fall re
corded is Campo del Cielo, from the Argen
tine Republic, 1783; and the first in the
United States is the Weston. Conn., 1X07.
Not every specimen offered to the collect
or of meteorites Is genuine; Indeed, mis
takes are common. Not long ago an old
farmer wrote to the Harvard Museum stat
ing that when he was a boy, in 1840. he had
aeen a shooting star fall in the field back
of his house; this he had now dug up, and
he was rSffly to receive an offer for it from
the Museum. On examination the supposed
meteorite proved to he a common boulder,
which had lain in the old man’s field for
20,000 years, more or less. It is oftentimes
a very difficult thing to locate the exact
spot where a meteorite falls. The blinding
light, the whole startling nature of the
phenomenon, will often cause an observer
to think that it has fallen close at hand,
when in reality the distance may be ns
much as twenty-five or even fifty miles.
Meteorites are either of stone, or of iron
mixed with nickel. Before the latter are
put on exhibition they are usually cut in

two to show a polished sutface, which Is

of the structure. Certain meteorites thus
treated show what are called Wldmanstaet
tlan figures—a form of crystallization of
great beauty which Is foutid in terrestrial
iron, and then imperfectly, only in speci
mens from Disco Island, Greenland, where
a mass of basalt has flowed up from the In
terior of the earth.
Meteorites, of course, are the only physi
cal evidences we have of the composition
of other celestial bodies than our own.
Their general scientific interest Is that they
probably represent the composition of the
interior of our earth. Although the Green
land Iron is the only terrestrial Iron resem
bling true meteoric Iron, the crust of the
earth contains rocks very similar to both
the stone and the iron meteorites, with
the exception that the meteoric iron Is rep
resented by some form of oxidization of
iron. The oxidization has taken place, of
course, in the passage of these rocks up
ward through the earth’s crust. Another
analogy Is drawn from the connection be
tween Iron and diamonds. In South Africa
diamonds appear in a rock much like an
Iron meteorite, with the distinction of oxidi
zation; and the first successful production
of artificial diamonds was from the cooling
of melted iron under pressure. Add to
these facts one more—that the Cano Diablo
meteorite has been found to contain micro
scopic diamonds—and it will be seen how
interesting a comparison of terrestrial and
celestial mineralogy may become.
ENTHUSIASTIC CONVERTS
There are Thousands of Them who Be
lieve as this Woman Does
Mrs. Ira Knowlton. of Butte, Mont., is
a most enthusiastic convert to the virtues
of Stuart’s Dyspepsia Tablets as a cure
for obstinate stomach trouble. She says:
‘‘I had poor digestion nearly all my life.
It now seems to me that for years I never
knew what it was to be hungry, to have
a good, natural appetite.
I was troubled with gas In stomach,
causing pressure on the heart wih palpi
tation and short breath. Nearly every
thing I ate soured on my stomach, some
times I had cramps in the stomach which
almost resembled spasms.
Doctors told me I had catarrh of the
stomach, but their medicines would not
reach it and I would still be a sufferer
had I not, in sheer desperation, decided to
try Stuart’s Dyspepsia Tablets.
I knew they were an advertised remedy
and I didn’t believe anything I read about
them, as 1 had no confidence in advertised
remedies, but my sister living in Pittsburg
wrote me las-t spring telling me how Stu
art’s Tablets had cured her and her little
daughter of Indigestion and loss of flesh
and appetite and I hesitated no longer.
I bought a 50-cent box at my drug store
and took two of the large tablets after
each meal and found them delightful to
take, being as pleasant to the taste as
caramel candy. Whenever during the day
or night I felt any pain or uneasiness in
the stomach or about the heart I took one
of the small tablets and in three weeks it
seemed to me as if I had never known
what stomach trouble was.
I keep Stuart’s Dyspepsia Tablets in the
house and every member of our family
uses them occasionally after a hearty meal
or when any of us have a pain or ache in
the digestive organs.”
Mr. E. H. Davis, of Hampton, Va., says:
‘‘I doctored five years for dyspepsia, but
In two months I got more benefit from
Stuart’s Dyspepsia Tablets than in five
years of the doctors' treatment.”
Stuart’s Dyspepsia Tablets is the safest
as well as the simplest and most conven
ient remedy for any form of indigestion,
catarrh of stomach, biliousness, sour stom
ach, bloating after meals, sympathetic
heart trouble.
Stuart’s Dyspepsia Tablets is not a cheap I
cathartic but an active digestive remedy
containing the pepsin and diastase which

pendent rates. It Is a trust against com
petition, which is designated as “cut rates. ’
Freedom in trade is one of the essentials
in American business, the theory being that
the best man will win. The people are sup
posed to be the arbiters, who will place
their money where they can get the best
return for it. Any organization of busi
ness men to control the market on any
other than purely market conditions, look3
in the nature of a trust, and cannot hope
to be permanent. The customer must re
main the master of the situation.
The drug business is one which has un
dergone a wide revolution. The drug store
was once located In the physician’s saddle
bags, whence he took his phials and 6 m*
poundtd his own receipts. Then
lished itself in the corners of dor of*-,
lices, and the powders and liquidtta silflre
handled as so much gold dust. In the evo
lution the drug business has become one
of the most extensive in the country. The
drug store is no longer a mere compound
ing shop. Tt requires room equal to that
of a first-class dry goods house to display
Hs wares, and Its medicine shelf is one of
the smallest items which go to make up the
whole. Necessarily such a business calls
for enterprise, quick sales and short profits
—exactly the same conditions which apply
to every other business of a general char
acter. It is no more the apothecary shop,
spoken of by our great-grandmothers, but
a wide and intricate business. Such a
house as tills could not be controlled by the
conditions, cramped as they were, which
have passed away.
We have but to look at the drug houses
of Atlanta to see what is here alluded to.
They require great capital to carry the im
mense stocks, the line of goods displayed
makes a variety show worth a railroad ride
to look at, they are excellently managed,
and not one of them could afford to go back
to tiie contracted condition of years ago.

‘‘I shall want you to go into the country

” ‘Low-neck dinners!’ What do you mean
by that?” said the lady. “Well, mam. do

By ELMO SCOTT WATSON
IW^TTILL the autumn of 1934 see the earth
bombarded with a shower of meteors
or ""falling stars,"" a spectacular dls
fv 1 J p ^ ay ""Nature's fireworks"" which
krS L jg will put to shame the most ambl
tlous pyroteclmlcal effort that the
mind of man could possibly devise?
Astronomers believe there Is a chance
. \\ *d that It will. For, according to their
calculations, such a display Is at least
» f * a year overdue. Here is the reason ;
On the nights of November 12 and
13, 1833, the world was visited with the greatest
shower of meteors of which there Is any certain
record. All along the eastern seaboard of the
United States people looked up at a sky that
was literally aflame with ""falling stars,"" many
of them as brilliant as the most brilliant ""fixed
star"" In the firmament. ""The stars fell on this
occasion like flakes of snow"" one observer has
recorded, ""and It was calculated that at least
240,000 of them had fallen during a period of
nine hours,""
Then people began to recall that exactly on
the same date In 1799—34 years earlier—there
had been a similar shower of ""falling stars.""
Again In 1868 there was a great shower and In
1867, one only slightly less spectacular than the
preceding year. Perhaps It was only coincidence
that these showers had come at S3 or 34 year
Intervals or perhaps It was another manifesta
tion of the regularity of Nature. At any rate,
the astronomers looked for another shower In
1899, but It failed to materialize. Neither did It
come the next year. Evidently the 33 or 34-year
period had been skipped entirely.
Still undaunted by the failure of the Leonids
(for that is the scientific name of these ""fall
ing stars"") to appear on schedule time In 1899,
the astronomers eyed the heavens hopefully on
November 12 and 13, 1932. But once more they
were disappointed, as they were again last year.
But some of them still think that this coming
November may see the display of ""Nature's fire
works"" similar to those of the years mentioned
above. What has happened to these showers of
meteors at periods of one-third of a century?
Nobody knows. The disappearance of the Leonids
Is one of the mysteries of science.
Meteors, except as they come In showers like
the Leonids, are not at all uncommon. There
Is never a clear, moonless night when you can
not step outside your house and see several of
them In the course of 15 minutes. The most of
them, of course, are very small—mere little wisps
of light that shoot across the heavens. But now
and then you may see a much brighter one. At
times, though not many of us will have the luck
to see It, one comes with a thunderous noise
like the roar of a cannonade, and a brilliance
that blinds the eyes.
What are the^e fiery travelers through our
heavens? Men used to think that they were actu
ally stars broken loose from their moorings.
Probably there are still many men who hold to
some such belief, but it Is very far from true.
The stars are great suns, many of them vastly
larger than our own sun, and millions upon mil
lions of miles distant from our solar system.
Meteors are the fiery display of stones, captured
out of space by the gravitation of the earth,
and heated to incandescence by the friction of
the air that blankets our globe. These stones
pierce our atmosphere at almost unthinkable
speeds, ranging from 28,000 to 160,000 miles per
hour.
What becomes of them? They do not pelt the
ground around us? No, the most of them are
burned to ashes while still many miles above
us. Every now and then, however, one that Is
too large to burn up before It hits the ground
does come. Such stones are called meteorites,
and many thousands of them, weighing from
several ounces to several tons, are on exhibit In
our museums.
Anyone — especially farmers — may happen
upon a meteorite. Prof. Harvey H. Nlnlnger of
the Colorado Museum of Natural History In Den
ver, who Is the world's greatest authority on
the subject, says that there Is probably not an
area ten miles square anywhere In the United
States, where at least one stone from the sky
Is not waiting to be found. It may be under the
ground, especially If It Is a large one, or It may
be out In plain sight.
His conjecture Is based on wide experience,
for he has himself collected more than 1,500 of
them during the past ten years. His specimens
may be seen In almost every large museum In
the world: In London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna; In
the Field museum In Chicago, In the Smithsonian
Institution In Washington, In the Museum of Nat
ural History In New York City; and In many
others. No other man has collected even one
tenth as many as he has. The most of Professor
Nlnlnger's stones have been bought from farmers
who turned them up while plowing, or who found
them In tramps across fields and pastures.
They are easy to recognize, when one knows
what to look for. Most meteorites are one of
tw'o kinds: Iron meteorites or stony meteorites.
The 'irons"" are always black on the outside,
when newly fallen; but when one has lain ex
posed to the air for a time, It will probably be
reddish-brown with rust In either case, of
course, It will be very heavy. Often, but not
always, It will have peculiar pits In It, somewhat
like a piece of putty Into which somebody has
pushed his thunibs and fingers. Any strange
piece of Iron, which Isn't clearly of some other
origin, may possibly be a meteorite.
Stony meteorites are a bit harder to Identify.
They, too, are always heavier than the average
earth stone; and also they are always black on

which fell near the present site of Winslow,
Arlr., some time before the white man came in
to that country. It Is almost a mile across and
600 feet deep. The meteorite, weighing several
million tons, is buried more than 1,500 feet be
low the level of the desert. (Photograph by
Fairchild Aerial Surveys.)
2. Prof. Harvey Nlnlnger of the Colorado
Museum of Natural History examining the Para
gould meteorite which he found himself and
which is the largest meteorite ever seen to fall
and later recovered. It fell at 4 o'clock In the
morning of February 17, 1930, near Paragouid,
Ark., and weighs, together with three other frag
ments broken off from It, 906 pounds.

the outside when newly fallen, turning to red
dish-brown In the course of time. Inside, how
ever, they differ greatly from Iron meteorites
and also from one another. One common kind
looks very much like a piece of graylsh-whlte
cement, covered with a coat of black paint; or,
If It Is an old fall, of black paint mixed with
rusty brown. Another kind is quite black inside.
Indeed, they may be almost any shade between
black and white under their outer crust.
Stony meteorites are ,also often pitted, but the
pits are seldom as sharply defined ns they are
In the Iron variety. After the surface has turned
from black to reddish-brown, It often looks a
good deal like the crust of a loaf of cracked
wheat bread, with similar little flakes scattered
over It These flakes may also be seen while the
surface Is black. They are flakes of metal.
To see a meteorite actually crash to earth Is
one of the most spectacular sights among nat
ural phenomena. One vivid description of a fall
some years ago tells ns that the noise was like
""heavy cannonading, accompanied by an unearth
ly hissing,"" and that the ground trembled as In
an earthquake. People rushed from their houses
In fright, and though It was midafternoon, they
saw a great ""dazzling"" ball of fire In the heav
'iike to the moon In size, sputtering and
ens,
throwing off a Igng train of sparks,"" and leaving
in Its wake ""a heavy line of black smoke."" This
meteorite fell In more than a thousand frag
ments near Forest City, Iowa. One piece, weigh
ing 66 pounds, fell near a farmer In a field and
buried Itself more than three feet In the hard
prairie soil
Hardly a year passes without a fall somewhere
in the United States, witnessed by persons who
testify to its splendor and frightening aspect.
Fortunately, however, we have never been vis
ited by a meteorite such as fell on the isolated
steppes of north-central Siberia in 1908. The
force of the air, blasting out from It, mowed
flat more than seven hundred square miles of
dense forest It killed a herd of 1,500 reindeer,
and forced a train, 400 miles south, to stop In
order to keep on the rails. A Russian farmer,
50 miles away, was knocked unconscious and re
turned to his senses to find the air so hot that
he feared his clothes would catch fire. His house
was demolished.
This great mass of Iron, buried deep In the
ground, is estimated to weigh 40,000 tons; but
it Is small indeed when compared to another
mass that fell on the desert plains near Win
slow, Arlz., In a time before the white men came
there. This enormous meteorite, which bored Its
way more than 1,500 feet Into the earth, is
known to weigh several million tons. It left
behind It a crater almost one mile across and
nearly 600 feet deep, as it appears today.
Many other tremendous falls have happened
since the world began. No doubt, If we were to
explore the bottoms of the oceans, we would
find hundreds of great masses of stone and Iron
burled In the slime. Other great masses are
buried beneath our feet, and the craters which
they left behind them have been obliterated
wind and rain. It has been discovered very re
cently, however, that traces of these craters may
sometimes be seen when viewed from aloft In an
airplane.
found In America during the past two years.
Where do meteorites come from? It is sup
posed that they are fragments of comets which
have been torn apart by the powerful gravita
tion of the sun and the larger planets of the
solar system. The Leonids are believed to be
fragments of Temple's comet, which has disap
peared like the meteor showers. Another comet,
known as Blela's, was actually seen to break up
and finally to vanish entirely; but now we are
showered with an unusually large number of
meteors whenever It should be In the neighbor
hood of our earth, according to the computations
of astronomers.
How many meteorites have really hit the
earth? Professor Nlnlnger estimates that more
than 87,000 of them have fallen on every square
mile of the earth's surface since the mammoth
roamed the steaming forests of prehistoric times.
That means that the very ground on which we
walk Is made up largely of the dust into which
they have fallen.
Confirmation of that belief Is seen In the the
ory advanced recently by Ralph W. Stone, as
sistant state geologist of Pennsylvania, that a
coating of meteorite dust 19 Inches thick lies on
the surface of the earth. This coating is an
accumulation of 60,000,000 years or more, he
says, and is constantly being increased, although
at such a slow rate that It Is not noticeable.
by
Several groups of them have been
Out of 470 meteorite falls since meteorites be
came known and accredited, 125 years ago, 130,
000 Individual meteorites have been recovered,
or an average of 277 a fall. This figure supplies
one meteoric stone for each 400 square miles of
land surface of the globe In a century and a
quarter.
Most of the falls were observed In areas of
comparatively dense population and where sur
face conditions were favorable for observation
of the landing and for recovery.
""If we consider the 287 witnessed falls In Eu
ropean countries, Russia, India, Japan and the
United States, amounting to 120,349 Individual
meteorites or 450 stones a fall, In a combined
area of 7,250,000 square miles, we have one me
teorite for every 65% miles,"" Mr. Stone says.
""During the 125 years only two falls from
which stones were recovered were observed In
the whole western third of the United States,
apparently due to spare population and the
nature of the terrain. Although practically all
observed falls from which stones are recovered
occurred in daytime, there is no reason for as
suming that falls are not just as frequent at
night.
""On these assumptions, It Is conservative to
estimate that In these twelve countries -at least
ten times as many meteorites fell as were recov
ered, or one to each five and a half square
miles.""
If the rate of fall of the last century has
been constant, according to the assistant state
geologist, each square mile of surface hat re
ceived 727 meteoric units. In the 60,000.000 years
since the beginning of tertiary times, on this
basis of computation, the earth received 87,240
meteorites a square mile.
""The weight of the 129,349 stones recovered,""
he continued, ""was 17,074 pounds. This Is a very
low average, since the larger stones usually bury
themselves, but tMs figure gives about two
ounces a stone.
""This would mean a five-ton a-square-mllo
average for the entire earth, In the last 125
years.
""Should we continue the computation for long
er periods we get Into ponderable figures. Then,
If we figure not from the beginning of the ter
tiary time but from early Paleozlc time, 000,
000,000 rather than 60,000,000 years ago, we get a
weight of material which certainly would make
the earth wabble on Its ails If concentrated In
one spot on the surface.""
Besides the meteorites which land, about a
million an hour dally are consumed In our at
mosphere before striking the earth, Mr. Stone
estimates.
""Considering five pounds the average weight
of these, that would mean 60,000 tons of mete
oric dust sifting down dally. Distributed over
the globe, however, the result would be a layer
one millimeter thick In 10,000 years, or a blanket
19 feet deep In 60,000,000 years.""

TRY )
Atlanta, May 10,—A scientific rec
ord of the fall recently of the firstl
nickel-iron meteorite in this section of
the country, now officially named
“The Pitts Meteorite’’ because of its
fall at that point in Georgia, April
20, has just been completed by Dr. 8.
W. McCallie, State Geologist and giv
en to the Telegraph for publication.
The Pitts Meteorite
By 8. W. M’'CALLIE
State Geologist
The fall of the Pitts meteorite here
deseribed was one of the most inter
esting phenomena of its kind hereto
fore observed within the limits of the
State. The meteorite which fell near
Forsyth, Georgia, May 8, 1828, and
deseribed by White in his ‘‘Statistics
of Georgia’’ was probably of larger
size but it was not witnessed by sc
many people nor did the attendant
phenomena seem to be so impressive.
The Pitts meteorite fell in a negre
settlement in the western part of Wil
cox county near the town of Pitts
about 9 o’clock (eastern time) April
20. No clouds were in view and the
sun was shining brightly, It was seen
as far south as Sunny Side in Henry
county, 36 miles south of Atlanta, and
as far south as Moultrie, in Colquitt
county.
In addition to the above towns that
appear to mark the north and south
limits of its visibility it was also
seen at Camilla, Albany, Seville, Cor
dele, Hawkinsgville, Perry Macon nnd‘
Alma. It was doubtless plainly visiblo‘
over an area of several thousand
square miles and could have been dis
tinetly seen by fully a quarter of a
million people had they been looking
in the proper direction.
My attention was first called to the
occurrence by press notices on the
21st’ of April and on the 22nd T re
ceived a specimen of the meteorite
from Col W. H. Dorris of Cordele
accompanied by a short deseription of
the phenomena. On April 24th T
visited Pitts with a view of securing
at first hand all the data possible
concerning the exact locality of the
attending phenomena ete. Mr. A C
Shell and other citizens of the town
rendered me inva]ua.blﬁ service in se
curing the informationw desired and
also obtained for me for examination
and study all the fragments of the
meteorite except one, which specimen
was. later secured from Gov. Dorse
Several hours were spent in the
vieinity of the fall interviewing eye

: The Phenomena |
The attendant phenomena witness
ed by the observers of the Pitts me
teorite were similar in character and
succeeded each other in the same or
der as that noted in meteorite falls in|
general. Named in order of their oc
currence they were: (1) A rapidly
moving' body often referred to as ai
fire ball; (2) A dense smoke in the
wake of the fire ball oceasionally
Auminous for several minutes; (3) Dis-!
tindt boomings generally compared tc.
discharge of distant canon, succeeded
by a number of lesser sounds; (4) A
roaring or whizzing noise not unlike
the sound of a £falling body; (5) The
falling of the dark body and its im
pact on the surface of the earth.
The rapidly moving fire ball was
the first phenomenon that attracted
the attention of the observers of the
Pitts meteorite. It was described as
witnesses at Albany as a rapidly mov-|
ing body about the size of a mans
head appearing in the sky in a north
easternly direction. At Moultrie ‘it
was referred to as a brilliant body
moving downward in a zig-zog course
looking as it might fall in the north
ern part of the city. At Sunny Side.
more than a hundred miles from the
place where it fell it was seen in a
southeasterly direction apparently
about 3 feet in diameter and two
thousand feet high falling nearly‘
perpendicular at a rapid rate. |
' Dense Smoke in Wake ‘
The dense smoke in the wake of
the flaming fire ball was referred tc
by the Albany and Moultrie witnesses
as a luminous trail following the
flaming ball. Colonel Dorris whg was
in the vicinity of Pitts speaks of the
smoke as a zig-zag trail lingering for
gome minutes and assuming various
shapes. These shapes were thought by
some to be in the form of letters. Sev:
cral persons in the im-.cdiate vieinity
a¢ e fall deseribel tie smoke as
white or gray in color and in the form
of puffs and very dense.
The first sound heard was compar
ed to that of thunder and to many it
was the first warning than any un
usual ocurrence was taking place in
the sky above. At Cordele 15 miles
west of Pitts the sound resembled that
of a heavy explosion distinetly heard
by several people on the streets. In
the country four miles east of Cordele
‘two terrific explosions were noted
louder than thunder which so terri
lfi«-d the farm hands that they ran
frightened to their homes. At Hawk
insville it was thought that an aero
plane had exploded over the city. In
che immediate vicinity of Pitts the
sound was described as several loud
explosions causing the earth to trem
ble followed in quick successions by
o number of lesser explosions.

19,19060422,New-York tribune. [volume],/lccn/sn83030214/1906-04-22/ed-1/seq-21/,New York [N.Y.],Daily,"•« can ride It,"" say the members of the 3d, and
Certainly some of the Ftnnts they do on horse
back would seem to warrant this assertion.
Every member aspires to the rough riding class
In which they are instructed in some of the
hardest feats of horsemanship.
The drill, under the direction of Lieutenant G.
O- N. Hornby. includes both team and thrp©
fcorae Human riding, in which the driver stands
erect u;>on the backs of his mounts. No saddles
axe usod. their places being taken by army
blankets strapped to th horses. To Insure foot
ing, the men wear robber soled shoes. Hurdling
Is another exercise. Overmounting, or springing
from the ground over the backs of one or more
horses to the back of another, with the animals
In full gallop, is still another. Wrestling on
horseback, mounted basketball games, pyramid
riding and other feats go to make up the list.
' A Tribune reporter talked the other day with
1 member of the '•'•d about the drill. Said he:
""Hurdling, even when seat* d in the saddle. is
hard enough, but when standing erect on the
horse's back it seems a hundred times worse.
There is that sudden lurch when the horse goes
into the air. 1 cannot describe it. To the begin
ner seasickness ann • compare with it. And
then there is the shook when the animal strikes
the ground again. More than one man lias gone
ever the beast's head through failing to brace
himself properly against that shock.
""Roman riding is no joke, either. Ever play
""bend the bow' on thin ice when you w«re a kid?
W«ll, that's about the nearest approach to the
sensation I can think of. First one foot £"">■*= up
and down and then the other, and foal as on the
Ice you half expect each foot will go through.
f the beginner at this nd at riding feels cer
tain that each foot is going to slip off the horse's
b:if k. The first ride of that kind I ever took
Lasted about ten seconds, but it seemed ten
weeks, and when I got back to earth again I was
reeking with perspiration.
""A fellow gets another sensation that makes
t.r.i think of home when be rounds a curve in
Ilomaa ridiijg. If they are not well trained or
v.(-'A in hand the horses have a way of pulling
away from each other that makes a fellow feel
he hiis certainly arrived at the parting of the
ways, and yet after it is all over he cannot help
feeling a bit thankful that there are still tailors
i:. the kind honest enough to use good stout
thread in one's clothing.""
The armaimnt of the battery is the Colt auto
raiir gun, firing five hundred shots a minute.
The men carry cavalry arms, and In addition to
ih#» artillery drill are drilled for cavalry service.
1:. the event of the battery guns being disabled
y would still constitute an efficient troop of
• aJry. The battery, which was organized in

Henry Kasquin, has frequently received the

across the base, 4 feet high and 2f> feet 4 inches
in circumference at the base. Its exact weight
is 31,107 pounds. While traces of cobalt und
phosphorus are found Jn the mass, it consists
I chiefly of Iron and nickel, there being more than
I 90 per cent of the Conner and nearly 8 per cent
of the latter. While hy no means the largest
meteorite known, It la of especial interest be
cause of Its deeply scored aides. The theory
NORMAN HAPGOOD.
has been advanced that this scoring is <lue to the
friction caused by the tremendous (oppression
of the air as the meteorite swept alone with
almost the speed of light in its cours ■ toward
the earth.
Because of this friction few aerolites reach
the earth. Th»y an- dissipated in n dair, the
first evidence of their destruction v,e:n~ the
fiery wake which forms the beauty ol the ""shoot
ing star."" When one does reach th.> earth It
comes in a flaming chariot which lights up the
earth for miles around. It is said thai when the
Athens meteor appeared in IST.'} all ol Greece
was lighted momentarily. It is thought that
w.h. n the Willamette meteor fell its lisht must
have been dazzling to the eyes a hundred miles
from the spot whore it struck.
The strange, unexplained appearance of th'ae
flaming stones has led to th.ir worship in all
times and countries. One of the nMcst meteors
known stan-Js in a corner of a temple in Mecca*
Its name is the Right Hand of God. It is saM
that long before Mahomet's time it was wor
shipped by Arabian tribes. Another meteor
which was once the object of worship fell at
some unknown time near Pessinus on the border
between Phrygia and Galatia. It was set up
and worshipped by the cult of Cybele. When
Flannibal was approaching Rome the Sibylline
books were consulted. The response was- thai
whenever a foreign enemy should enter Ttaly ha
could be expelled if the meteorite, called the
Ida?an Mother, were brought from Pessinua to
Rome, This was done, and Hannibal was forced
back to Africa. A temple was thereupon erected
to the honor of Cybele and the stone worshipped
in it. It is supposed that ""the image which fell
down from Jupiter,'* mentioned in Acts •«""*•*,
35, was a meteorite. Meteorites which haw
fallen in countries occupied by primitive peoples
within the last century have been made cb
jecta of veneration.
The Museum of Natural History has foor
great meteors besides the Willamette. One of
these, the one lying under the arch of the en
trance, is believed to be the largest In the world.
It, with two of the others, was brought by Cap
tain Peary from the Arctic regions. One of
those at the Museum is an extremely rare speci
men because it contains a diamond. The collec
tion is considered one which cannot be dupli
cated. Those which rank next are in the British
Museum and the School of Mines, Mexico City.
Portrait of Benjamin Franklin Re*
stored to This Nation.
No one knows Just why the British abstracted
from the dining room of Benjamin Franklin's
house in Philadelphia, In 1777, the portrait at
the owner and carried it to England. After an
absence of 130 years, through the courtesy of
Earl Grey, Governor General of Canada, It has
been returned to this country through Mx.
Reid, the American Ambassador to the Court
of St. James's. It arrived here on the steamer
St. Paul last Sunday, Just In time to add In
terest to the celebration of the 200 th anniver
sary of the birth of the famous American,
which occurred on April 20. The picture was
addressed to President Roosevelt.
AH these years the portrait has hung on the
walls of the ancestral home of Karl Gn-y, In
Northumberland. It was carried away by his
great-grandfather. General Grey, who was with
the British troops quartered in Philadelphia
in 1777. General Grey occupied Franklin's
house. According to a letter Major Andre was
the one who removed the picture from Its place.
As be did not return to England, he doubtless
turned it over to General Grey. It was prob
ably taken away when the city was evacuated.
ITranklin was In France at the time, negotiating
a treaty with that country. It would be In
teresting to know just why the British took
and so carefully preser%ed this picture of their
great enemy.
The announcement that It was to be returned
to this country was made at the dinner of the
Pihjriins on March 31, at which Karl Grey was
present.

Birmingham in Alabama, and as
far away as Greenville, Miss.
Dr. Walter B. Jones, Alabama
State geologist, said that evi
dently a meteor exploded over
Central Alabama and that Mrs.
Hodges was hurt by a particle
of it.
Mrs. Hodges said she was
lying on a couch in the living
room of her home when the
meteorite smashed through the,
roof and tore through the ceil
ing about 2 pm. 1

“We had a little' excitement
around here today,” Mrs.
Hodges told him. “A meteorite
Tell through the roof.”
Mr. Swindle said the meteorite
measured about six inches in
diameter, and weighed approx
imately nine pounds. The in

MDTE, MOTIONLESS,
'BY DIVINE ORDER'
For More Than Two Years Man
in Hospital Has Not Moved
or Spoken.
Philadelphia,* March 31.Laboring
under the delusian that he has received
a divine command to remain absolutely
mute and motionless, and that death
and the fires of hell await him if he
disobeys, a man whose name is not di
vulged has lain like a log on a cot in the
Philadelphia hospital for more than two
years.
So far as the physicians have been
able to learn, he is not suffering from
catalepsy^ There is notliine whatever
wrong with him physically. The pupils
of his eyes respond to light, his heart
action is regular and sustained, altho
somewhat weak, and his breathing is
normal.
Nearly every prominent doctor in the
city has seen this man, but none can ex
plain the phenomenon -in any other way
than as an unheard-of freak' of insanity.
First Affected on Street.
One day in the fall of 1902 he was
seen to be acting strangely in Chestnut
street, near Thirteenth. He was walk
ing rapidly down Chestnut street, when
he came to a dead stop and stood for
fifteen minutes. A -policeman ap_
proached him and told him to move on,
but he did not stir.
The exasperated policeman rang for
a patrol wagon but he could not induce
the sphynx to step into it when it ar
rived. It was necessary to tip him over,
{)ick him up as tho he was a log and
ay him in the bottom of the wagon.
At the hospital he spoke rapidly and
timorously for the last time. Apparent
ly he was afraid he might be overheard.
""Almighty told me not to move, not
to speak,"" he said. ""I'll be damned if
I do.""
Cannot Frighten Silence Away.
""And,"" said a doctor who was dis
cussing the case yesterday, ""I'll be
damned if he has.""
Once they tried to frighten him by
rushing into the room where he lies and
crying ""Fire!"" But he did not stir.
He has listened with the utmost im
perturbability to a party of doctors
suggesting that it would be advisable to
cut him to pieces.
A bit of ice pressed to his temple
with the command, ""Speak, or Pll
shoot!'' was equally futile. He has to
be fed by artificial means, because he
refuses to open his mouth.
""The only thing I know of that will
ever make him move or speak,'' said the
doctor, is another divine command. If
he gets it, and if he obeys it as im
plicitly as he has obeyed the last ope,
the problem of perpetual motion will be
solved.''

METEORS PAY AS
1. A KANSAS CROP
Farm Mortgages Have Been Lifted
and Homes Built as Result
of Fallen Bodies.
Lawrence, Kan., Mareh 81.Probably
no state in the United States has bad
the strange incidents resulting from tho
fall of meteors as has Kansas, and
piobably no man in Kansas is as fa
miliar with the unconventional inci
dents connected with their fall as Dr.
F. H. Snow, professor of organic evo
lution, systematic entomology and me
teorology of the state university.
Farm mortgages have been lifted,
nomjBg built and money saved for old
age on the profits of the meteorite
trade in the sunflower state. It has
really been a trade, and at times the
centers of the meteorite fields havo
been the scenes of business activities,
because there is a big demand in east
ern and European markets for the celes
tial bodies that have struck the Kan
sas plains.
The phenomena of these terrestial
substances was practically unknown to
the average Kansan until 1890, when
a sort of meteoric panic sprung up in
Kiowa county, and farmers that hail
their last eighty acres mortgage-bound
were some instances saved from
financial destruction by the find of me
teorites on their land.
It was in April, 1890, that Dr. Snow
first found any traces of the heavenlv
bodies. The news that came to him
was indirect, but he immediately sent
an agent to Kiowa county. Upon the
agent's report that all meteorites had
been sold, Dr. Snow took the next
train. When he arrived at Greensburg
he found that New York representa
tives had been trying to buy all the
meteorites and that his agent had
missed valuable sales by a fraction of
an hour.
Dr. Snow found A. B. Kimberly, who
had obtained possession of most of the
meteorites which had been found in
that section. At first Kimberly refused
to consider Dr. Snow's solicitations, but
i finally led the scientist around the end
I of a haystack and after some digging
and scratching revealed a small me
teorite, which was immediately bought
\}j ProfeBsor Snow.
Mr. Kimberly had already sold more
than two thousand pounds of this new
kind of fortune maker, and it took lit
tle persausion by Dr. Snow to obtain
Kimberly's services for further search.
Kimberly said he knew where there
was another larce meteorite, but a law
yer owned it and it probablv would be
hard to buy. Kimberly went to the
lawyer, who had been using the meteor
ite as a yard ornament for ten years.
Kimberly induced the lawyer to sell
it for $3, and within an hour sold it
to Dr. Snow for $150. This was a har
vest for Kimberly and saved his farm
when every foot of it was mortgaged
and foreclosure seemed certain.
Woman Saved Up the Meteors.
The meteorites were first discovered
by cowboys, who knew absolutely noth
ing of their value. One day Kimber
ly wife was reading of fallen meteors
and their value. She believed the stony
substances would be valuable, but the.
husband refused to listen to her and re
peatedly bartered the meteorites off for
meager offerings. Just as often as
Kimoerly bartered the meteroites his
wife managed to get possession of
them, altho ridiculed by her neighbors
and members of her family. By the
time Kimberly had sold the first ""2,000
pounds and other ^masses to Dr. Snow,
he had more money to put in the bank
than his crops had netted him in sev
eral years.
An incident demonstrating the great
desire of collectors for these meteorites
occurred when Dr. Snow bought a 218
pounder from a farmer named Evans in
Brenham. He found Evans on his
farm, but the metorite was in town at a
grocery store. On the way to town
Dr, Snow closed the deal whereby he
gave Evans $500 for his prize.
When they reached Brenham, a tele
gram was awaiting Evans from Mr.
Kuntz of New York, who had offered
$1,100 for the meteorite. The agent
threatened litigation, but Dr. Snow fin
ally convinced him that the $500 sale
was closed before the message had any
effect. Dr. Snow was offered $1,500 for
this 218-pound meteorite by the direct
ors of the Austrian Museum in Vienna,
but refused, and still has it in his col
lection in the University Museum.
Dr. Snow received a letter a year ago
from Kimberly's son. He had been
making a meager living by day labor
and raising hogs. While feeding his
hogs his foot hit a hard substance near
ly buried under ground.
When he found it was a meteorite he
wired Dr. Snow and the sale was imme
diately made, whereby Dr. Snow bought
the stone composition, which weighed
168 jpounds. It is now in the American
National Museum in New York city.
This meteorite was an exceptionally
rare one and is the largest of its kind
in the world. It took several hundred
dollars to persuade young Kimberly to
part with it, and Dr. Snow, in his sale
to the New Yorkers, cleared enough to
give him a profit.
Many Meteorites Found.
The Kiowa county fall was of un
usual quantity and twenty-five to thirty
meteorites have been found there. Most
of them were sliced and polished and
the slices have brought high prices.
Dr. Snow, in his collection, has one of
the few in the world that have been
left just as found. I is estimated by
scientists that not more than two or
three whole Kiowa county meteorites,
or of similar composition, are in the
possession of any museum or scientist
at the present time.
On farms where the meteorites were
found in Kiowa county the farmers
ploughed their land as it had never
been ploughed before. On some farms
the ground was ploughed and cross
ploughed two and three times.
Washington county has a share in the
fall of meteors. But thus far only one
has been found that was worthy to be
placed on the market. B. C. January,
a farmer living near Washington, was
visited by a meteor fall at noon one
day in July, 1890. He took his meteor
ite to county fairs and charged an ad
mission fee to see it. Before he sold it
to Dr. Snow, January had cleared sev
eral hundred dollars on his ""meteorite
show.''
As January lived on a rented farm, a
woman in New York, who owned the
place, instructed her agent to bring suit
for recovery of the meteorite. Dr.
Snow paid the agent money in addition
to that paid January and settled the
title. Several eastern firms made offers
of $800 to $1,200 for this meteorite.
Another small meteorite was
ploughed up on a farm near Tongan
oxie, in Leavenworth county. H. C.
Fellow found it while preparing the
ground for corn. It weighs fifteen
pounds and is polarized. One end is an
attractive magnet and the other repul
sive.
In 1896 a meteorite weighing less
than six pounds fell on Joseph. Black's
farm in Franklin county and struck
within two hundred yards of where Mr.
Black was standing. Mr. Black found
that it had buried Itself more than a
foot and had cut off cornstalks.
All of the meteorites in the universi
ty museum here belong to Dr. Snow.

Franklin motor-cars have been more thoroughly tested than any other cars in the world.
What other stock car has been in so many races and come out with such flying colors
has borne itself so well in endurance and hill-climbing contests has cut the record from New
York to San Francisco in half but, above all, has proved itself reliable in the hottest, as
well as the coldest days of the year?
The Franklin has done all of this and the reason is its

The following, by the school children,
were given the Herald for publication
some time since, but have been crowded
over for want of space:
METEORS AND METEORITES.
Meteors are small bodies of iron and
stone traveling through space around
the sun. They travel at the rate of
forty miles per second. It takes them
thirty-three years to make the circuit.
They are visible almost every night.
Sometimes they are as numerous as
twenty or twenty-five. They are some
times called “shooting stars” and “fire
balls.”
The meteors meet with the earth
about every thirty-three years, in No
vember, and then we have our mete
oric showers. We had one in 1833
which was the grandest sight ever seen.
We had one in 1866. There was sup
posed to have been a shower in 1899 but
as we think that the earth passed only
through the first part and that we will
have our shower next year. So you
may look for the shower next year in
November.
Meteorites are larger bodies of stone
and iron passing through space. When
they fall they generally reach the
earth not whole, of course, because they
are burning when they fall. Did you
ever think that when you see a meteor
fall that it was a star falling? And that
there was one star less in the sky? O,
no, there will be just as many to-night
as there was two thousand years ago,
and there probably never will be any
born.
I saw a meteorite that fell here in
Stearns county, It was as large as a
pail. It was composed of stone, iron
Fifth grade.
METEOR AND METEORITE.
A meteor is as large as a marble
and a meteorite is very much larger.
They travel forty miles a second. We
should not call the meteorite and mete
or shooting stars, because they are
not shooting stars. If a star should
fall it would cover the earth and the
world would come to an end; that is
why they never fall. A meteor burns
up forty miles above us and so it does
not reach the earth.
A meteorite is made of iron and steel.
We saw a meteorite yesterday in our
school; it fell ten miles out of town. It
dug a hole two feet in the ground; it
did not cover itself over but it threw
the earth right off of it on each side.

Third grade.
METEORS AND METEORITES.
They are supposed to be parts of
comets or something out of the vol
canoes in the moon.
A small meteor is as large as a mar
ble. If they fall to the earth they are
larger. The difference between a met
eor and a meteorite is that a meteor
is a great deal smaller than a mete
orite.
They travel about forty miles a
second. When they reach the earth
they have a white glow, and the inside
is very cold while the outside is very
hot, because while they are passing so
swiftly through the atmosphere the
outside is melted.
The earth has a certain path and
the meteors have a certain path which
is larger, and when they meet we see
the meteors and meteorites, We see
showers of them every thirty-three
years. About one hundred thousand
fall every night.
A star is a sun like our sun, but
some stars are a great deal larger
than others. If a star should fall and
reach the earth, the earth would be
burned up in a second. Mr. Stanton
brought a meteorite into our room
yesterday. It was found by Mr. Cai r
and another man on Mr. Baldwin’s
farm. The meteorite spread the earth
around where it lay, so the men put
their hands under it and lifted it out.
The State University wants it. It
weighed twenty-nine pounds.

METEORS AND
Meteorites are larger than meteors.
Meteors and meteorites fall but mete
orites reach the earth. The meteors
do not reach the earth because they
burn up before they get here.

Stare do not fall, if they should the
world would burn up. The meteors
look like falling stars as they go
through the sky every night.
The meteorites do not fall every
night. The meteorites are large rocks
with iron in them. It is thought that
they come from volcanoes or the
planets.
Meteors travel twenty to forty miles
a second.
When the meteorites reach the earth
they break in pieces. The one I saw
was a meteorite. It weighed twenty
seven pounds.

A METEORITE.
Mr. Stanton brought a meteorite in
our room. It was up in the sky. It
fell down on the ground. It was heavy
and looked like iron. When it fell it
made a big hole in the ground. It
was big enough for two boys to get in
it. It fell very fast to the ground.
When it got here it was very hot.

prominent women of the day in the
authorship of a series of singularly
frank articles about to begin in the
The Ladies’Home Journal. The arti

character is in a way revealed in the
title of the first article, “Have Women
Robbed Men of Their Religion?”
which the writer boldly answers in the
affirmative. The series will then go
on and deal with the exact conditions
prevailing in girls colleges, reveal

drawing some emphatic deductions
which will awaken unusual interest.

Didn’t do a Thing to Him.
The man who has run about a bit thinks
he knows the origin of the expression, did
n’t do a thing to him, which was frequently
heard a year or two ago ago, and is not en
tirely obsolete today. The phrase was bred
and spread from apolice station in the neigh
borhood of Causeway street in Boston. A
patrolman brought in oi.e night a prisoner
with a badly cracked head. Two or thret
officers had been concerned in the arrest o.
the fellow, and it was explained that his
wounds were the result of an attempt to
break away from his captors. The lieuten
ant looked at the blood streaks on the man’s
forehead and said: “L'.ok here, Jim,
ypu’ve used this duck up pretty well, you
didn’t have to soak him like that, did you?
} Oh, that must have been one of the other
boys, said Jim, scenting a lecture. I didn’t
do a thing to this one.
Oh, no, you didn’t, shouted the prisoner in
angry irony. Oh, no you didn’t do a thing
to me, you didnt. You didn’t do a thing to
me. He gave Jim various titles which, in
spite of the undeniable advantages of realism,
cannot be repeated here, and he was led oft
to the cells still ejaculating: Oh, no, he did
nt do a thing to me. Just as the patrolman
whs leaving the guard room to go back to
duty a second officer with a second disturber,
gathered a little later near the scene of the
frdlic, came in. The offender’s head was as
badly cracked as the others had been. The
lieutenant smiled at Patrolman No. 1 and
said to Patrolman No. 2, Well Reilly, I see
you didn’t do a thing to your man either.
The joke was told the next day and as the
jokes of those in authority are quick to be
come popular, the phrase was soon in use
throughout that station, and no man show
ing the results of a fight, could be brought
in thereafter but some one would say, Well
they didnt do a thing to him, did they? So
it spread over the country.—Worcester

The American farmer appears to be catch

John Mitchell, former president of ths United Mine Workers of America,
who recently accepted the position of manager of the trade agreement depart
ment of the Civic federation.
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT MADE
LAW FIT VETERAN'S CASE.
Latter's Arm Was Useless But Not
Amputated—Ingenious Interpre
tation of Provision Results
in Larger Allowance.
Lone Tree, la.—In a letter found
among the effeots of the late J6hn W.
Jayne of Lone Tree, is told the man
ner in which President Roosevelt se
cured an increase of pension for Whit
taker Jayne, of Colorado, the son of
John W. Jayne. The two Jaynes, fa
ther and son, one a middle-aged man
and the other a mere youth, served
throughout the civil war together in
the same regiment, until Whittaker
Jayne was wounded at the battle of
Shiloh and was honorably discharged,
his right arm being disabled. It is
with this arm that the Roosevelt story
has to do.
When the president was on a hunt
ing expedition in Colorado early in his
present administration, he stopped for
some days near the ranch owned by
Mr. Jayne and was an occasional vis
itor on the property. The first time
Mr. Roosevelt came to the house there
was a demonstration in his honor by
all the little folks in the neighborhood.
The children carried flags and sang
patriotic songs in honor of the presi
dent _ _ _
y
'
«m
X.
&
Mr. Roosevelt had not met Mr.
Jayne, had never even heard of him,
but as he came up he said in his char
acteristic, hearty manner:
I might have known an old soldier
lived here. No one else would have
arranged such a patriotic demonstra
tion.
When the two men were introduced
the president noticed that Mr. Jayne
extended his left hand.
What is the mattefr with your right
arm?"" he asked.
The old soldier replied that it was
shattered by a bullet at the battle of
Shiloh, that the elbow was stiff.
Do you get a pension?"" was the
next query, and then: ""How much?
""Don't you know,' asked Mr. Roose
velt, when he had learned the amount,
""that if your right arm had been am
putated above the elbow ÿou would
receive a much larger pension?""
Mr. Jayne knew it.
The president continued:
So you have an arm and you have
not an arm. What you have is use
less and you ought to get as large a
pension as if you didn't have it. Now,
I don't regulate the pensions, but I
name the men who do, and I am go
ing to use my influence to get you the
pension you deserve.
The president did not forget his
promise. Before he left he asked Mr.
Jayne if he had any pension blanks,
and receiving an affirmative reply, ob
tained one of them.
The next Sunday Mr. Jayne went to
church with his family. Mr. Roose
velt was there and, seeing Mr. Jayne
on the other side of the building, went

tf
over to him at once.
*T sent the blank to Washington,
the president said, ""and you can now
be expecting your increase.
The letter to the late John W. Jayne
was written immediately after this last
conversation, so it does not record the
change, but any one who knows Mr.
Roosevelt's penchant for getting things
done may easily guess that Mr. Jayne
is drawing a pension for the arm
which lost its usefulness at Shiloh.

Trades Suit for Coffin.
York, Pa.—When an undertaker
went into the tailor shop of his friend
Elmer E. Bowers, ordered a suit and
said he had no money, Bowers Joking
ly replied: ""We'll take it out in'
trade."" Bowers became ill the next
day, was operated on for appendicitis
and died. The undertaker furnished
the coffin.
GERONiiVIO USES A LARIAT.
;id Warrior Aids in the Branding of
Steers by Indians.
Lawton, Okla.—Although old Ger
onimo is fast failing in years, caused
by ihe awful hardships he experienced
during the days that he held the
west and southwest in terror prior to
1886, he can still lariat a steer with
great accuracy. He is now busily en
gaged with many of the Apaches ro
ping the young calves of the Apache
cattle, and assisting in the branding
of several thousand yearlings. This
work is being done while the Apache
Indians are making their annual
round-up of cattle on the range of the
Port Sill military reservation. All cat
tle are being collected at the Rock
Island tanks, near Elgin, where the
calves will be branded.
A complete invoice of everything be
longing to the Indians is to be made. It
is estimated that the Apache herd of
cattle contains 10,000 head, probably
the largest single herd in Oklahoma.
Ope of the interesting things in con
nection with the herd is the fact that
there are very few dry cows. .This
year there was the largest ""crop of
calves"" ever raised on the reservation.
According to the usual custom of
handling the Apache cattle, the cows
are numbered, and in branding all
calves are branded with the same num
ber as their mother. The heifer calves
are retained—no cows being sold until
too old for active life on the range,
and the greater number of steers are
shipped and sold.
Each Indian owns cows bearing his
numbers, and the young cows bearing
the same number become V s proper
ty. It is estimated that there are ap
proximately 500 steer calves this year,
which will* bring the tribe about
$25,000.
BIG PRICE FOR METEORITE.
New York Museum Pays More Than
$2,000 to Seattle Finder.
Seattle, Wash.—-The largest price
ever paid for a meteorite, will be
given for the one found last fall by H.
G. Herold of this city, who, while
cruising off the timber lands in What
com county, located what is declared
to be the largest meteorite on record.
After a great deal of correspond
ence with a number of museums, Mr.
Herold has finally made a bargain
with one in New York city, and, while
the price is not revealed, Mr. Herold
states it is over $2,000. Mr. Herold's
meteor is ten feet in diameter, and 14
feet in length. It is located in the for
ests in the foothills In the eastern por
tion of Whatcom county. The second
meteorite in point of size, Mr. Herold
says, Is approximately ten feet in di
ameter and is oval shaped. It. is now
on exhibition in the New York Muse
um of Natural History and is known
as the Peary meteorite, its weight be
ing 90 tons.
How the New York museum people
are to get this meteorite out of the
woods is a problem. Mr. Herold be
lieves those attempting to handle it
will have to wait until snew covers
the ground and then place it on enor
mous skids, made from trees, and
slide it out over a road previously
cut. It is not far from a railroad and
the grade to the railroad is all down
ward.
WAITER REFUSES DOLLAR TIP.
New York Man Establishes Record by
Rejecting Diner's Gift.
New, York.—Honus Muller, a waiter
in the Pavilion, Eighty-fourth street
and the East river, established a
record the other afternoon when he re
fused to take a tip from a diner.
Shortly, after one o'clock a young
man and woman alighted from an au
tomobile and entered the Pavilion. At
Honus' table they proceeded to con
sume $10.60 worth of food. When
Honus handed the gentleman the
check he was offered a one dollar bill.
That Is for yog,"" said the young
man.
If you will pardon me, I would rath
er not accept that money. I am be
ing paid a good salary for waiting on
you, and I cannot conscientiously ac
cept your tip,"" replied Honus to the
surprised diner. Then the would-be
tipper and the young woman departed,
throwing the bill on the floor. How
ever, Honus did not pick it up, leav
ing It to some one else.

All this may mean that bar

Floating through space in our
solar system are over a thousand
minor planets, known to astrono
mers as asteroids. Over 1.410
of these asteroids have been ob
served and given names which
run from A alt jo down to Vassar,
according to a recent listing by
Hugh S Filer of the Hayden
Planetarium of the American
Museum of Natural History. Of
all the asteroids little Fros a
tut of matter some 12 miles long
and a mile or two wide is per
haps the most familiar.
If Professor Lipman’s findings
for meteorities are true it may

teroids also carry life sh a latent
form. Gradually, as with comets
and larger meteorites, the aster
oids are breaking up through
gravitational forces which vary
as they pass near or far from a
planet. Eventually they break
into tiny hits ami then into dust
particles. But each particle could
contain its own bacteria that
have been there for eons of time.
It will thus he seen that inter
planetary space may be filled
with a kind of 'dust or fog” of
latent life, some of which will
eventually float down upon any
planet fitted to receive it.
Because our own Earth is now
so teeming with livtng things we
should not now notice any such
happening But in the hegtning
when the world was young and
without life such a ""IHist of

as I have done the fundamental
question of 'How Did Life Be

By speculating that life may

jor Clifford? Alice was dead.
She was sure of that. There was
no hope of restoring life. There
was nothing, absolutely nothing
she could do to help her. And
no one had seen Kay there by the
body. Supposing she pretended,
even to herself, that this terrible
thing hadn’t happened, supposing
she went on to the island now
while there was still a chance...
At any other time in her life
it would have seemed fantastic
to Kay that she could think that
way. But ever since Ivor's death
had plunged them into chaos. her
standards had fantastically
changed From the beginning
she had . always thought of Ma
jor Clifford as the enemy. Wasn’t
it only consistent that she carry
her policy to this extreme, law
less conclusion ?
She felt a little dizzy. But be
hind. there was her ever-increas
ing determination. It wasn't
for herself that she had to do this.
It was for Terry, Terry who had
turned criminal to save his
father’s life, Terry who could so
easily be charged with murder if
the truth w r ere known but who—
surely—was innocent.

While her Impulse was at Its
crest, Kay turned back abruptly
and started hurrying through the
pall of rain aw-ay from the house
toward the dock.
That furtive Journey through
the rain had all the quality of a
nightmare. Although it was
practically impossible that she
should be seen, she carefully
avoided the slave-cottage where
Constable Masters w’as sheltering
and moved along the drive in the
lee of the oleanders. But it
wasn't Contable Masters of whom
she w f as really conscious any
more. It was Alice Lumsden.
As she skirted the bicycle shed
and stumbled through the knot
ted grove of cedars down to the
deserted dock, the memory of
Alice, like a revengeful ghost,
seemed to stalk silently after
her.
She paused a moment on the
wet jetty, trying to locate the is
land through the blinding sheet
of the rain. Water had seeped
through the coat now, soaking
her so that her Very pores seemetf

something eerie about the dead
passivity with which the sea re

half full of rain water, lying low',

laborious, and that eerie feeling
was heightened as if dead fin

back.
Once, as silence came after
thunder, Kay’s imagination heard
a faint splash behind her. And,
horribly vivid, the Image came
again, in the rain, moving inex

and miraculously, she made out
the vague blur of the island dock
Almost before she realized it. the
loggy canoe had bumped against
it. She made the boat fast and
scrambled up onto the jetty.
She was there.
Still haunted by that unnamed
fear, she ran through the rain up
the short path which led to the
playhouse. She saw the little cot
tage only when she was nght
up to the blue Dutch door. Her
pulses throbbing as if she were
reaching sanctuary, she tugged
the door open and slipped inside.
For a moment she stood there,
not feeling anything except th«
fact that the rain was no longer
beating down on her. Then, the
panic image of Alice Lumsden
loomed in her mind again. In

stayed there, leaning against the

warm drink.
It was dark here—dark with a
sort of submarine dusk as though
the rain, streaming dowm the

rding to Professor Kdniund Otis Hovey,
curator of geology at the American Museum
of Natural History. there are records of only
? 685 meteorites which are represented in
:;- and private cabinets. Others are
. led in the earth, of course, but they
never havo been found. Contrasted with this
'??? ted number is thc estimate of astronomers

hundred miliion meteorites enter the atmos?
phere of the earth every day and through
cremation by friction against the air are dls
? .: of as i ffectually as dust that is absorbed
by a vacuum cleaner.
In the recently published ""Outline of
Sci< re,"" edited by J. Arthur Thompson, it is
said that meteoritc-s in so-called ""empty space""
swarm like fishc.s in the sea. Like the fishes,
moreover, they may be solitary or gregarious.
The solitary bit of cosmic rubbish is the mete?
orite. A ?'.social"" $!-roup of meteorites is the
essential part of a comet. The nucleus, or
bright central part of the heud of a comet,
ci nsists of a swarm, sometimes thousands of
miles wide. of these pieces of iron or stone.

Meteorites, according to Professor Hovey,
?'e Senerally divided into three classes ac
injr to their mineral composition. First
er? are ""Biderites,"" or iron meteorites, com
posed principally of an alloy of iron and nickel.
Second, there are ""siderolites,"" or ironstone
meteorites. These are a nickel sponge or
meah, the interstices filled with stony sub
stance. Third, there are ""aerolitea"" or stone
meteorites, but which nevertheless usually
have grains of iron and nickel scattered i'n
their mass.
These are the aubstancea that have been
found in meteorites which are also found in
the earth: nickel-iron, olivine, chrysolite, pyr
oxenes, feldspar, diamond, graphite, hydro
carbons, cohenite, pyrrhotite, tridymite, chrom
ite, magnetite, osbornite, lawrencite and glass.
But certain other substances have been
found in thcsc bodies that have never heen en
countered elsewhere in the arth. These have
been named raaskelynite, schreibersite, mois
sanite, troiHte, daubreelite and oldhamite, each
substance, obviously, taking the name of its
discoverer. It is these new substances that give
the constantly waged seareh for new me.teoric
bodies such a glamor of fascination. A sci
entist is always lured to make further investi
gations by the hope that sometime he wil] en
counter a substance, perhaps a philosopher's
stone, that may explain our very existence,
and the lay mind. at least, likes to toy with the
idea that there may turn up the fossilized re?
main* of some form of life that has existed
elsewhere than here on earth.
The heaviest weighing meteoric mass known
10 have landel on earth is Ahnighito, an iron
meteorite weighing more than thirty-aix and a
half tons, which was brought from Cape York.
Greenland, by Admiral Robert E, Perry. ln the
same ""fall"" were two other heavy bodies that
were named by the natives who discovered them
""the dog"" and ""the woman"". For generations
these metal masses furnished thc Greenland
ers with material for their knives and other
hunting weapons. All three of these are to be
seen in thc foyer of the American Museum
of Natural History.

Ahnighito. or the ""tent"" to employ the Eng?
lish equivalent, had it reached earth this year
instead of ten thousaind or more years might
have shattered the Woolworth Building or sunk
the Majestic ""spurios versenkt.""
When it was suggested to Professor Hovey
recently that meteorites offer a reasonable ex
planation of the faiiure of some ships to reach
port he was at first amused and skeptical. but
tiien he sobered and agreed:
""It might happen. It. might happen, true
enough.""
Strangely enough meteorites have a favorite
aiighting place in North America. and it is
more than likely that there are acres of the
ocean that exert an attraction for these wan
derers equal to this region of the southern
Appalachians,' where the stalcs of Kentucky.
Virginia, Tcnncssee, North Carolina, Georgia
and Alabama adjoin. A circde with a radius
of 300 miles drawn about Mt. Mitchell, North
Carolina, as a center will include nearly half
of the known meteorites of North America.
Twenty-five of these, or nearly half of the
known ""falls"" of the continent, are observed
""falls,"" and it would seem possible at first that
many of the meteorites in this area might
have come from a single shower. This would
reduce the number, but the writer has made
a careful study of the history of each meteor?
ite and its geographic relation to those of sim?
ilar character without finding any support for
such a view. Not only does the area contain
a large number of observed ""falls,"" but the
""finds"" embrace a variety of type3 larger than
any known to be produced by a single shower.
As regards population in the area conditions
are only moderately favorable, since the area
is not very thickly settled. Meteorites are su
perabundant in this area. This seems to leave
little doubt that some force tends to bring
about their conccntration here. It is note
worthy that this region includes the highest
summits of the Appalachians. and this suggests
either the presence of an extra gravitational
force or that a purely obstructive effect has
been exerted by the high peaks. Studies-of the
gravitational effects of mountain masses in?
dicate no force seemingly sufficient to affeet
the fall of a meteorite, though some such force
may exist. Magnetic influences may also he
suggested. Next to the massing of meteorites
about the southern Appalachians (the Black?
stone, Va., fall of May 11 may be included in
this area by stretching the radius of a trifle),
the most striking grouping seems to be within
the borders of Kansas.
Meteorites nearly always take the name of
the town nearest which thev fall. Out in Ar
S2
i7,ona. near ( anyon Diablo, is Meteorite Moun?
tain, and scientists expect that eventually
there will he uncovered there the largest mete?
orite that ever struck the earth. This 60
called mountain is really a butte, 200 or 300
feet in height, rising from a plain. It is ten
miles south of Canyon Diablo station on the
Santa Fe Railroad. Climbing the rock-strewn
sides of this interesting hill brings one to th.e
edge of a bowl-shaped depression in the earth
that is 600 feet deep and a mile across. Here,
according fo Indian tradition and thc theory of
scientists, a giant meteorite, as large in cir
cumference as the rim of thc bowl, struck the
earth in ages past. Thc Moki Indians whose
homes are near hy, have kept alive f< r count
less generations tbe story of the fall of a blaz
mg star ages ago, appalling the savages who
were dazzled by its fierce light and shaken by
the trembling of the earth. lt' tiie theory of
the scientists is correct, the great mass plung
ing itself into the earth forced up the edges of
the crater just as embossings appear when a
pebble is dropped into soft mud. Strata of rock
were displaced and clouds of steamingdust and
sand were sent into the air, only to fall back as
a grave covering for the great body. A shaft
more than 200 feet deep has been sunk into tlie
rentev ot' th.e crater by a mining company that
decided that profitable operations might be con
ducted if the main body of the meteorite could
he reached. They pushed their work all tim
harder when it was discovered that iron frag
ments contained diamond.-. There is still a
vast amount of research work to he done at
Cauyon Diablo, and until it is finished none can
say what cosmic secrets are hidden in that
great dish.
New York State was the target for a mete?
orite just about the time the Civil War was
brewing. Th.e only portion of this heavenly
visitor ever found is now in the possession of
the state at Albany. It is a stone and weighs
four ounces, though the parent body undoubt?
edly weighed a great many tons before it was
consumed hy fire or shattered by an explosion,
This meteorite is known to scientists as ""Beth?
lehem."" The story of its encounter with
the earth is preserved in one old account as
follows:
""On the morning of August 11, 1859, a'
seven o'cloek and twenty minutes or there
abouts, thermometer T.'l , air still and the sun
shining brightly, a meteoric body of great
size and hrilliance was observed throughout a
large portion of western New England and
?!astern N'ew York, which. exploding violently,
ihrew down to the earth at least one fragment
of its mass in the vicinity of Albany. New
York.
New York State Jarred
By Meteor in 1959
""The main facts connected with this inter?
esting phenomenon collected from numerous
and widely separated observers are as follows:
""By observers, generally, north of Albany,
the meteor is described as appearing in thc
southeast at an elevation of from 453 to 60?;
thence it passed rapidly to the south and dis
appeared a littie west of south at an elevation
of from 10' to 15'. It? course throughout its
visible range was marked by a heavy train or
trail of smoke which continued visible for
some time after the meteor itself had disap
peared; and at two or three points in its course
large volumcs of smoke were observed to form
as if the result of successive explosions.
""To observers, generally. south of Albany
(20 miles or more distant) the meteor was first
seen in the northeast and disappeared to the
northwest; a fact which indicates the path of
the body to have been nearly coincident with
the parallel of Albany.
A few minutes after the disappearance
of the meteor. the lapse of time being
variously estimated hy differently located ob?
servers at from 30 seconds to two minutes. two
or three loud and successive explosions or re?
ports were heard. accompanied by prolonged
echoes and a violent concussion. These sounds
have been compared hy some to sharp and
heavy peals of thunder, to the report attending
ihe explosion of a powder mill or steam boiler
and also to the rumbling of heavy carriages
on a bridge.
""The estimates formed of its fize aro ex
ceedingly discrepant, some observers compar
ing it to the sun. or full moon, and others to
a skyrocket or the luminous hail projected
from a Roman candle. All agree, however,
that ita appearance, even in full sunshine, waa
exceedingly bright and dazzling, the light be?
ing at the same time of a reddish color. So
bright, indeed, was it, at Stafford, Vermont, a
locality nearly 100 milea north of the prob?
able point of explosion, that the distance was
estimated at. not exceeding one half mile from
the point of observation.
A Meteor That Arrived
ln a Thunderclap
""A single fragment only of the meteor is
positively known to have fallen. This wa?
found in Bethlehem, Albany County, X. Y.,
and at a point about ten miles west of Albany.
The circumstances connected with the phe
nomenon related by the person who noticed it
ave aa follows:
""While standing in the enclosure adjoining
his house his attention and that of his family
was attracted by a loud sound overhead, which
somewhat resembled thunder; and a few min?
utes after a stone struck the southeast side of a
wagon house. and bounding off rolled into the
grass. A dog lying in the doorway started up
and ran to the place where the stone fell. When
picked up immediately after it was found to
be quite warm and possessed considerable
sulphurOus odor. The fragment in question was
small, about the size of a pigeon's &cr^, and
irregularly shaped. Nearly three-fourths of its
superficies was covered with a black, non
lustrous, evidently fused crust, while the ro
mainder presented the appearance of a fresh
fracture, and was of a light gray color, and of
a granular or semi-crystalline texturc. Its
com position was apparently siliceous and not
metallic. This specimen was bought by the
regents of the State of New York and is now
depesited in the state cabinet at Albany. Other
fragments are reported to have fallen in th-?
vicinity of the Hudson, but careful inquiry has
thus far failed to discover them.
""From the above facts it seems evident that
the meteor* of August 11 was of immense size,
probably of tons weight, and that it exploded
violently at no great distance above lhe sur?
face of the earth.""
As was said, Lloyds probably would insure
any one for a million against death by getting
hit by a meteorite, for the price of a ride on a
bus, but still they better net write too many
policies of that kind, for some time the earth
may go shouldering into a mass with such
force as to rive asunder this planet and the
widows and orphans of their policyholders
might swamp them.
Still, as we said, they'll probably take a long
chance on it if they are asked.

To answer this question several things
need be said. First, to encounter the
swarm by daylight would result In noth

Again, how far the swarm extends no one

while the earth was In another part of
her orbit; hence, If not met now. It may
be at the time of Its next recurrence—
ISSt Further, there may have been slight
miscalculation, for absolute accuracy does
not attend the computations for these
meteors that go with a prediction of a
solar eclipse, for example; Indeed, there Is
a quarter of a year added to the thirty

D. The swarm was then coming through
space from some Immensely distant hut
unknown quarter, moving more and more
swiftly under the power of the sun's at
traction What started them snd hbw
they originated can hardly be even guess
ed. Perhaps. Indeed, they entered our
system In the form of a tomet, which
was afterward broken up, for the close
relation between some meteoric swarms
and some comets has been established. As
these meteors approach the sun they hap
pen to venture near the orbit of the planet
Uranus; their manifest purpose was to
pass right on undisturbed, come as near
the sun as they might, swing about that
central body and then hasten back Into
space, possibly never more to come this
way. But Uranus happened to be In that
part of Its orbit where the meteors were
to pass, and, massive world as It Is,
through the power of gravitation. It
brought Irresistible force to bear upon the
flying meteors, seeking to draw them to
Itself. Their speed was, however, too
great, and they were simply deflected from
the orbit which they were following snd
given a new direction Meanwhile, they
were swiftly passing beyond V ran us and
freeing themselves from hl» grasp. But
""fall*."" so called. which ara represented, j
Ordinarily. perhaps, each meteoric mm
which 1* found represenla a separate fall;
but often a meteorite splits Into several
pieces, falling tlfty or l'lO miles distant
from one another, on striking the earth's
atmosphere. The common orlKln of suck
pieces la often demonstrated bv analysis
or hy general appearance, but more often,
perhaps. It remains in doubt.
About 2?5 full* are represented at Har

In estimating comparative value—of about
pounds. The largest meteorite

Peary in Greenland The largest meteo

THE MORGAN PUBLIC LIBRARY AND MUSEUM.
The cut represents a meteoric stone weighing 1S4 pounds which has been
the basis of a hotly contested lawsuit lasting two years. It has recently been
sold for $2,000 to Professor Henry A. Wnrd of Chicago, who is the owner of the
$100,000 collection of extra terrestrial bodies on exhibition In the New York
American Museum of Natural History. It is a ""stone meteorite"" as distin
guished from an ""iron meteorite."" It fell in a forest in Kentucky, and the Under
and the owner of the property on which it fell resorted to law to settle the own
ership of the treasure. The suit was finally compromised, and the sale was ef-.
fected. Beyond Its value as a rarity this meteorite is practicably worthless.
The cut illustiatts a naval maneuver recenfty tried in England whereby a
dummy submarine boat drew the fire from an opposing warship while a real
boat was doing its deadly work. The commander of the subterranean flotilla
caused a canvas copy of the conning tower and a short length of the deck of
the submarine to be prepared. This was fitted to the top of a submarine and
was easily detachable from 'within. The boat, with its decoy, then bore down
to attack the battleship and on coining within range released the bogus subma
rine, -which floated to the surface and was greeted with a storm of fire from
the battleship. Ii the meantime the real submarine crept up to the ship and
launched a torpedo at her huge enemy at close range.

‘SERPENT’ In LAKE TAHOE
TURNS OUT TO BE BEAR
ON 4-MILE SWIM
%
Listen, my children, and you shall
hear—another sea serpent story.
Believe it or not, Claude Simmons
and a party of friends yesterday
were driving around in the vicinity
of Lake Tahoe when much to their
surprise they saw a black, queer
looking object going through the
waters of the famous lake at great
speed.
They knew the object was neither
man nor boat', so having read the
papers, they decided it was a sea
serpent. It was broad daylight and
the group decided to watch the
serpent and his travels to a finish.
At last the serpent reached the
shores of the lake, and from the
waters emerged a large bear. With
never a backward glance it lumber
ed off into the hills, probably ready
to settle down for a long winter’s
nap.
Simmons said that the bear had
crossed the lake from Bijou to Elk
Point, a distance of about four
miles. — Nevada State Journal.
GOLD, RUBIES, BERYL
IN DRILLED WELL
Gold, rubies and beryl were dis
covered in a well hole recently com
pleted at Overland Pass as part of
the government’s drought relief
program.
A. G. Burnham, who has charge of
drilling of wells for the govern
ment, recently completed the well at
an elevation of 6,799 feet. The well
was drilled 450 feet deep and during
the drilling gold, rubies and beryl
were discovered in the well core.
The beryl is so hard that it cut
through the hard tempered steel
drill. — Elko Free Press.

METEORITE PICKED UP
Hurled into space from another
planet, a 43-pound meteorite was
picked up last week in Amargosa
valley, near Rhyolite, by L». J. Mur
phy and taken to Tonopah, where it
was presented to C. C. Boak, who
sent a specimen of the find to the
Smithsonian Institute for scientific
analysis, the Goldfield News says.
The meteorite struck the earth
with such force that it embedded
itself in solid rock, causing puzzle
ment to Murphy when he found it.
He did not recognize it as first as
a meteorite. — Humboldt Star.

Blank U. S. Check
WASHNGTON, </P) — Secretary
of treasury Snyder made plain to
day that he does not view the
Marshall plan for European recov
ery as giving foreign countries a
blank check on the United States
for what they need.
Snyder told a news conference
that secretary of state Marshall
was not extended an implied invi
tation to other countries to tell
this nation “what they need or
want.”
•My interpretation is that he is
asking them to make a self-inven
tory and see what they can do for
themselves,” Snyder told report
ers.
Meanwhile, Marshall said at an
other news conference that he
does not plan to have a represent
ative attend the talks of British,
French and Russian foreign min
isters concerning his European re
covery program. Tlie.se discus
sions are scheduled to begin in
Paris Friday.
As’-ed whether he plans to have
an observer there, Marshall said
-he does not.
He flatly declined to give out
any more information now about
these proposals. When a ques
tioner referred to the program as
“your proposal” Marshall inter
rupted quickly to say the reporter
meant the American government
proposal.

Pravda Says Aid
Plan Doomed
! To Failure
LONDON, bP) — Pravda, the
Communist party organ in Rus
j sia, dashecj cold water today on
i the warm, friendly feeling which
has encompassed Europe since the
! Soviet Union accepted last Sun-'
; day a British-French invitation to
(talk about the Marshall A:d-Eu-‘
i rope plan.
With Soviet foreign minister V.
M. -Molotov reportedly scheduled
to leave tomorrow for Paris,
i where the three-power talks will
; get under way Friday. Pravda
1 said no self-respecting European
nation could accept the Marshall
proposals if acceptance meant
American interference in the in
ternal affairs of those nations.
It said the business world of the
United States was trying, through
the Marshall program, “to weaken
the ripening economic recovery
1 of Europe and that the “Greek
Turkish aid program was doomed
to failure.
U. S. under secretary of state
William L. Clayton continued his
| conferences on world economic
affairs with Prime Minister Att
! lee, British foreign seertary Er
nest Bevin, and Sir Stafford
Cripps, president of the board of
trade. U. S. ambassador Lewis W.
Douglas also attended the talks
, today.
One high British government
source said Britain would defer
final decision on cutting her buy
ing program in the United States
“at least until the full scope pos
sibilities of the Marshall aid-Eu
rope plan emerge.”
This apparently was in answer
to previous reports that Washing

In Iowa, towns along the lower

Fort Dodge, la., lost its power

In northeast Nebraska, a crest

to reach Norfolk last night. Yes

Neb., where a fourth of the city
was under water, emergency cen
ters were set up at the city hall
and hospitals to handle hundreds

Columbus was three miles wide.
Rail and highway traffic in Ne
braska, Iowa and Missouri was
shipped completely in many areas
by huge gaps in pavements and
track beds, but torn telephone and
telegraphic lines were being re

such curtailment might amount to

SOMfi FACTS OF METEORS.
Fragment of Comet's Tail Some
Historic Hot Stones That Have
Fallen.
The atmosphere forms an ar
mor which is almost impenetra
ble to the meteors that are con
stantly peltiny the earth. Most
of the meteors are small. They
come rushing through space,
strike the atmosphere, and the
friction against the molecules
of air heats them to a white
heat, and sets them ablaze.
Sometimes part of one may
reach the earth; but as a rule
they are consumed and the dust
aloiie, cosmic dust, drops Upon
the surface. One of the earliest
known meteors fell in 20i B. O,
in Phrygia, where for a long
time it was worshiped. It was
carried to Rome aud was sup
posed to be a messenger from
the gods. Livy describes a
shower of meteoric stones. The
people were greatly alarmed
and the Senators were demoral
ized and declared a nine days'
festival to propitiate the gods.
There is at Mecca a meteorite
r "" in 600 A. D.. and is
-ttrhicti ' '
still worshipped. by the tanmui.
In Chinese literature there is
mention of meteors which fell
in 044 B. C. The oldest kuown
raeterite which was seen to fall
Is now on exhibition at En
Sisheim, Alsace, Germany. In
l ......
1492 it came crasmng uuwu
through the air with a roar th-t
prostrated the peasantry Wltri
fright. It bmied itself deeply
in the earth. It weighed 260
pounds aud hangs today iu the
parish church.
The Chupaderos meteorite,
which weighed twenty-five tons,
fell in Chihuahua, Mexico. The
largest meteorite known is the
Peary stone, which weighs ap
proximately one hundred tons.
The stone of Canon Diable
weighs at least ten tons and
exploded high in air, the pieces
being found all over the sur
rounding country. In Italy sev
eral instances are kuownilof the
loss of life from meteorites. A
peasant was sitting in his cabin
and was killed by an iron mass
that crashed through the roof;
the act was regarded as a visit
ation of divine anger. The
one that has been struck by a
meteorite. A meteorite of sev
eral pounds' wei""ht fell In the
ueart of that city in the year
1600, on the authority ot Paolo
Maria. Tezaayo. and struck a
Franciscan monk.
More remarkable are the falls
at sea That a ship could be
struck seems an extraordinary
chance, yet a Swedish ship was
so struck, the stone killing two
of the crew. On Dec. 1, 1H90
the ship Walkomming was sail
ing from New York to Bremen
when her officers noticed a bril
liant meteor that appeared to
be bearing down on the vessel
from southeast to northwest. It
passed with a loud roar and
hissing sound and plunged into
the sea ahead of the ship. That
it was a meteor of large size
was evident, for a few minutes
later the ship was struck by a
tidal wave. Even more remark
able was the experience of the
British ship Cawdor, which
reached San Francisco Nov. 20,
1897. During a severe storm a
large and brilliant meteor was
observed rushing down upon the
ship, and with a roar and tilling
the air with fumes of sulphur it
passed betweeu the spars of the
ship and fell into the sea not
fifty feet from the rail.
One of the greatest curiosities
possessed by man today is a
supposed fragment of a comet
iu Mazapi), Mexico. The frag
ment is believed to be a part of
the tail of Beila's comet. In
1846 something happened in
space; a wreck occurred. Bie
la's comet may have collided
with another comet; in any
case, the comet divided, and
many living observers remem
ber seeing the two parts g
ally seperating. Som
pursued one pa
its
of space, and was so cold that
its effect was like a burn. This
fragment is now to be seen in
the Field museum. Of it, Dr.
Farington, the curator, said:
' This is perhaps the only in
stance known where the cold of
space has become perceptible
to human senses.""

The average meteorite imme
diately after its fall is intensely
hot; but at least one, which was
handled immediatly after fall

of space. A few men can say
that they have experienced this.
A meteorite exploded above
Dhurmsala, Kangra, Puujaub,

was picked up immediately by
some natives, who .dropped it
with expressions of pain. The

where good whisky marfes bad

and made rich for telling a lie;
where professors draw their
convictions and salaries from

tickle the ears of the wealthy.
Where business consists in
getting property in any way
that will not land you in the
penitentiary; where trusts hold
you up and poverty holds you
down; where men vote for what
they do not want for fear they
will get what they want by
voting for it; where women
wear false hair and men dock
their horses' tails; where men
vote for a thing one day and

TERRESTRIAL BOMBARDMENTS
The report of a large meteorite or where it landed in the Chulitna
country recalls similar visitations of terrestrial bodies in times past,
not the least of which was a shower of meteors on the Kuskokwim many
years ago. and the falling of a large meteorite north of the main Alaska
range in the direction of Fairbanks about 1922.
Recounting the shower of meteorites, the late Charles Brown of
the firm of Brown & Hawkins, said he was driving dogs along the Kus
kokwim river when the sky became ablaze with myriads of shooting
stars, as they were termed. So brilliant was the light and uncanny the
spectacle that it was too much for his malamutes, which stampeded
and gave him a go in an effort to control them.
Thus far, no one has located the meteorite of 1922, which had the
appearance of being of large dimensions, gauged by the glare of light
which followed.
Should the meteorite in the Chulitna country be found, or any
quantity of fragments proving it is of the same material as the great
mass which drove its way several thousand feet into the Arizona desert,
affording one of the modern wonders of the world, it should be rich in
platinum and nickel.
A meteorite which fell in central Nevada, not far from Boulder
Dam. fractured in several pieces, a portion of it being discovered by
prospectors who gathered it and shipped it to smelter for silver ore,
and received a good return. It was disclosed whether the payment was
for the value as a meteorite or its silver content.
Unless later discovered, a part of the Nevada meteorite was found
by an Alaskan resident in 1905, who staggered upon it while half dead
from thirst and therefore unable to carry away a specimen.
One of the things that makes crime easy is the fact that the crim
inal can feel reasonably certain that his victim does not have a gun.
The law against carrying concealed weapons might profitably be re
pealed. There would be less kidnapping and fewer hold-ups if bad
men knew that they were moving amid a populace ready to protect
itself with a rain of pistol bullets and buck shot.
An advertisement in the States says: “Our eggs have been tested
three times.” Yes, to crawl, walk and fly.
Since a man’s wealth is gauged by what he owes it appears that
the Allies and Uncle Sam are fighting for a place above the salt.
A new rubber device muffles a singer’s voice so his practicing does

Since Congressman La Guardia is busy picking victims for reprisals
such as Henry Ford, who appears to be about the only man throwing
his millions into the pot instead of asking the government to shoulder
the responsibility of creating employment, he might check up his own
constituency, boasting a gangster to the yard, and do a little high
jacking for the benefit of his socialistic theory.

HEM SAFE, SOUND
Fears that Game Warden Wm.
B. Healy, of Kenai, was lost in the
! Iliamna district were quieted Mon
day evening when Anchorage radio
station KFQD broadcast word that
Healy was safe and that he was ex
pected to reach Hans Seversen’s
home at Iliamna sometime Monday.
Rumors were circulated at Kenai
recently that Healy had become
| lost and this information was im
1 mediately forwarded to Juneau.
Alaska Game Commissioner H. W.
Terhune then ordered Warden
Jack O’Connor, of Anchorage, to
i take an airplane and go into the
district in search of the man.
O’Connor left Anchorage last
Saturday in an Alaskan Airways
plane piloted by Matt Neiminen.
At the Seversen home he learned
that Healy had gone down the lake
and that it was Healy’s intention
to return to the Seversen home as
soon as his trip was completed.
The plane then took off and pro
ceeded down the lake, flying over
the various trappers’ cabins in that
area. At one of the cabins Healy
came out and waved a greeting to
the airmen who circled overhead.
The plane was unable to land there
i so proceeded on the way back.
O’Connor is now back in Anchor
S age.

METEORITES GOOD.iXS GOLD.

till? Unrlh.
If any one Is no lucky, as to find one
of the thootiug stars Iri the meteoric
bhovvers, hf may congratulate himself
on having captured a prize worth Its
weight in gold. The number of col
lectors of meteorites Is Increasing, and
the competition between ilie different
cabinets, public mid prlvnte, hns caused
n groat advance In the price of rare
specimens.
The largst and finest collection of
meteorites o this side of t lie Atlantic
Is the one in the Hurvard Mlnet.iloglcal
museum in Cambridge. Reckoning
European collections It ranks about
fifth or skth in the world. The Brit
ish museum hns the best collection, ns
It has. of so many other things, and the
cnbinrtts n Vienna and Paris .rank
r.c't. s.i)s the New York Sun.
Calcinating the comparative value of
collections Of meteorites is something
of an art. A mnin point to be taken
into conspiration is the number of
""falls."" so called, which are repiescnt
ed. Ordinarily, perhaps, each meteoric
mass, which is found represent ? a sep
arate fall; but often a meteorite splits
Into several pieces, falling 51) or 100
miles distant fiom one another on
striking the earth's atmosphere. The
common origin of such pieces is often
demonstrated by anal sis orb general
appearance, but more often, perhaps,
It lomains in doubt.
About 275 falls are represmted at
Harvard, with a total weight another
factor In estimating comparative value
of about 2.S00 pounds. The largest
meteorite known is the famous one dis
covered by Pear) in Greenland. The
largest imeteorlte in the Cambridge
collection weighs 1,100 pounds. But
the largest meteorite is not necessarily
the most vafuable. Much depends on
the matter of ""control."" A ver.v large
and famous meteorite is Canon Diablo,
o cal'.ed in accordances ith the recog
nised rule for naming meteorit s, from
the localitj in Aiionn where it was
found. Here great piece of a thousand
pounds or moie can be obtained b nnj
one who wants them foi the tiouble
and expense of carting them nwaj. In
other words, no one controls it. and it
has little or no money value. On the
other hand, a much smaller and less
interesting meteorite owned wholly
or main. bv ,i single cabinet is IiUelj to
be worth hundreds of dollars. single
small piece of some notable meteorite
thus held ma easily be valu d. for ex
ample, at the I ate of $75 or $100. pound.
The pound, indeed, is much too ,lums,
a standard for so valuable a material
as meteorite stone or iron, and the
weight of a'.I specimens is rtcoidtdi in
tlie catalogues In grammes
In ancient times and among savage
tribes meteorites have alvv.i- been
lookid upon with more or Ins owe,
and have often been objects of worship,
'the Palladium which fell at Troy, for
example, was doubtless a meteorite.
In thiee small meteorites discovered
bv tlie Peabody museum on altars
r.iNed b the mound builders of the
L.it.e Miami vallej in 'Ohio. Harvard
possesses the onl authentic prehis
toric examples known to eist. Such
archaeological or historical interest
naturally adds much to the market
value of a meteorite. A well-known
American collector recmtlj secured
from the shah of Persia a number of
pieces from a famous semi-sacred
meteorite w'hich .had been in the pos
session of the royal famll for genera
tions, and b disposing of bits to va
rious European museums on his way
home, was able, he said, to pay all the
expenses of his trip""to Teheran.
The earliest American fall recorded
is Campo del Cielo, from the Argentine
republic, 17S3; and the (list in the
United Slates is the Weston, Connecti
cut, 1S07.

Bishop ""Lawrence, of Massachusetts,
in an address at the Episcopal confer
ence nt Providence, R. I., declared
that, while the rich nre becoming
richer, the poor nre becoming poorer.
Then he declnred that he would soon
er trust n rich man in ofllce than a
poor man in office with the rich man
on the outride.
""In the long run,"" he said, ""It is
only to the man of morality that
wealth comes. We occasionally, like
the psalmist, see the wicked prosper,
but only occasionally. The savings
are in the hands of hundreds of thou
sands of hard-working men, and
scores of thousands of men whose In
comes ten years ngo were from $2,000
to $5,000have now from $5,0CO to $1C,-
OCO.
""As to the multi-millionaires, only
a small fraction of their incomes cnn
be spent for their own pleasure; the
bulk of what they get has to be rein
vested and becomes the means where
by thousands enrn their wnges. They
are simply trustees of a fraction of
the national property. When, there
fore, the question Is asked: 'Is the
material prosperity of this nntion fa
vorable or unfavorable to the pros
perity of the people?' I may say with
emphasis: 'In the long run and by
all means favorable. ""

in
nena of Cornelias Vanderbtlt If aji
Delayed . the Arrangfrneots at
""The Breakers,"" His Newport
Palace.
NEWPORT, R.I.,. . . When a young
lady with a hundred million dollar papa
marries a young man with a sixty million
dollar father, it- means a -wedding some
thing out of the ordinary. Such a wedding
will take place Aug.. 19, unless the fates
intervene, and by it two of the most notable
families of the country will be united in
kinship.
Less than three months ago the engage
ment was announced of Miss Gertrude Van
derbilt,, eldest daughter of Cornelius Van-de.-bilt,
to Harry Payne Whitney, eldest
son of William Collins Whitney. Both
fathers are known in financial circles the
world over, and the father of the young
roan is known personally, or by reputation,
by all of the great statesmen of every na
tion on the globe.
Two weeks ago it was feared that the
serious illness of Cornelius Vanderbilt.
father of the bride-to-be. would interfere
with the marriage and possibly curtail the
series of brilliant entertainments which
Mrs. Vanderbilt had planned to give during
her stay at "" The Breakers."" While the
illness of the father did interrupt many of
the plans, his rapid improvement has made
it possible to continue the arrangements
for the wedding, and unless there is some
sericus relapse it will probably take place
on or about the Oate mentioned.
Almost any other family which intended
having a great w'edding would be sadly in
convenienced unless the date were definitely
set months ahead and all the arrangements
carefully planned beforehand. But in the
household of Cornelius Vanderbilt it is a
different matter. Mrs. Vanderbilt could de
cide one evening to give a great ball the
following r.ight, and everything would be
as grand and as elaborate as weeks of or
dinary preparation could make it. This is
due simply to the posver of money.
At ""The Biiealtcrs"" there is always on
hand a staff of house servants numbering
for;y, each one of them well drilled and
capable. Then there are great conserva
tories at hand, from which supplies coulu
be drawn to fill any breaks made by the
florist. The Vanderbilt chef and his as
sistants could, with the aid of a caterer and
his staff, turn out delicacies enough to
tickle the palates of a thousand. No or
namentation is needed to improve the in
terior of '""The Breakers."" Anything added
anything, matters have been delayed. Miss
Vanderbilt'e trousseau is completed, and it
Is ail of American make., Like her father,
she is a sturdy little patriot, with a firm
belief that America produces the best of
everything. Had she been so inclined this
young girl of twenty could wed a foreigner
with a glittering title, and with die great
wealth at her command rival the social
doings of her cousin, the Duchess of Marl
borough. But her father has always been
opposed to foreign alliances, and on several
occasions has stated his belief that his
children will have more real happiness if
they are married to Americans.
Miss Vanderbilt ""cam cut"" a year and a
half ago. Naturally, as the daughter of the
richest man in society, she received un
limited attention. But if she had been the
daughter of a much poorer man it would
have been just the same, as she possesses
the rare qualities wliich win friendships on
all sides. She is modest, unassuming, sym
pathetic, sensible and pretty. She knows
how to talk, and talk on topics other than
those usually discussed by the butterflies of
fashioa.
Unlike most wealthy New York girls, she
was net sent abroad to school. The best
masters which money could hire came to
ber father's house and instructed her io
everything which a girl so fortunately sit
uated should know. She is of medium
height, with a slender, graceful figure,
beautiful brown hair, which curls naturally,
gray-blue eyes and the fresh coloring of a
country girl. She has a dimple in each
cheek, and wben she smiles, which is very
often, these two little dimples add immense
ly to her many other chirms. What Miss
Vanderbilt's wealth will be is a matter of
conjecture, but that It will be measured by
millions is as good as a certainty.
FORTUNATE YOUNG WHITNEY.
Harry Payne Whitney, the young man
who has captured Miss Vanderbilt, is twenty-four
years old. He graduated from Yale
five years ago. Ultimately he will inherit
most of the wealth of hia father. He is a
fine type of young American manhood. Al
though with an immense income at his
command he has kept clear of the vices
which bestrew the path of the rich young
men of the metropolis. He divides his
time between his father s office and the
various country clubs in the vicinity of
New York. He is one of the best pWo
players in the country and his only extrav
agance is the purchase of polo ponies, of
which he has a magnificent stable.
A year ago Mr. W. C. Whitney began to
buy up land 'on the sound side of Long
Island in the neighborhood of Old West
bury. When he had purchased 450 acres
he gave orders for the construction of a
magnificent house, which, when it is com
pleted, will be the finest country home on
Long Island. This place, it is said, will be
given by Mr. Whitney to his son on the
day of the wedding. It is located in the
heart of the Long island hunting district.
Near by are the palatial residences of E.
D. Morgan, J. D. Lanier and General Tor-
rence, of Chicago. The latter won undying

If two noted Arctic explorers should hap
pen to meet at the same place in the
frozen North there is apt to be a big scrap
and if it once begins there will be no
danger of police interference. These two
explorers are rivals and enemies, and
moreover they are both now on their way
to Melville Bay for the express purpose of
bringing back a gigantic meteorite which
lies half buried in the ground on the shore
of the bay. It has been there for ages,
and the native Esquimaux call it the
""gTeat iron stone."" Both of these explorers
claim the meteorite as his particular prop
erty, but the one who gets there first will
gain the prize.
Lieutenant R. E. Peary is one of the
rival explorers and Professor Lewis Lindsay
Dyche, of Kansas, is the other. Lieutenant
Peary is more widely known than profes
sor Dyche. but in the scientific worldthe
latter is held in the highest esteem. He
has made several trips to the Arctic re
gion in search of tne Pole, and on one
occasion journeyed north with Lieutenant
Peary. Something happened on that occa
sion which caused an estrangement, and
now they are anything but friends. When
Lieutenant Peary returned a year ago
from his eventful trip to the North Profes
sor Dyche wrote a long article in which he
showed that had it not been for a series
of blunders made by Peary the North Pole
would have been discovered. This, of
course, did not lessen the breach between
the two.
START OF THE RIVALS.
""When it was announced a short time ago
that Lieutenant Peary was going to start on
a journey to Melville Bay to bring back the
great meteorite. Professor Dyche said noth
ing, but immediately packed up and left his
homo at Lawrence, Kan. A week later the
news was given out that he was going to
bring back the meteorite. Dyche left about
the let of July, whereas Peary did not leave
until July 1G. On that date he sailed in
the steamer Hope from Sydney, C. B., ac
companied by a number of scientists. Hen

Peary, is one of the party; also Hugh Lee,

POTENT CAMPAIGN FACTORS
How the Candidates Shake Hands at
the Rate of Fifty a. Minute or
3,000 per Hoar.
An incidental feature of the- Presidential
campaign will be the handshake of the
four leading candidates. The other day
Mr. Bryan shook the good right hands of
4,000 men, women and children at Lincoln,
and it is a common occurrence for Major
McKinley to shake hands with 500 persons
in an afternoon. Mr. Hobart has extended
a hearty grip to pretty nearly every one
in Jersey, while Arthur Sewall has made
the good people of Maine swell with pride
by his cordial generosity in. the handshak
ing line.
Grasping tbe hands of such vast multi
tudes was a new thing for Bryan, Hobart
and Sewall, but they have all now settled
fifty people a minute for two hours at a
time, grasping the dainty fingers of a so
ciety belle one second; falling into the iron
clad clutch of a horny handed son of toil
the next second; shaking the mushy paw
of a bargain-counter dude the third second;
catching the diplomatic hand of a million
aire the fourth second; fondling the pudgy
palm of an influential dowager the fifth
second; pressing the oily hand of a fat
politician the sixth second, and so on
through every grade of the human family,
tickling the pet emotions and. flattering th
respective vanities of each. Handshaking
is judged to be a simple thing by the un
thinking, but when it is elevated to a high
place among the arts it becomes an intri
cate science.
THE BRYAN GRIP.
Mr. Brvan's shake is a device tingling
with emotion, bubbling with enthusiasm,
sizzling with vigor, bursting with confidenca
and volcanic in its heartiness, cordiality
and good will. But it is artful, like the
hand grasp of every schooled statesman.
Mr. Bryan never allows the visitor to do
the shaking or the squeezing. He does that
and so do McKinley, Hobart and Sewall.
It's a matter of self-preservation, and after
a little practice the habit becomes instinct
ive. The art lies in grasping the extended
fingers of the visitor and holding them
in such a position that the visitor cannot
get a good grip on the candidate's palm.
The caller may try to Blide his palm further
along, but the fingers of the candidate

If Mrs Vanderbilt has a full week, with
out interruptions of any kind, to prepare
lor her daughter's wedding it can be counted
upon to be the grandest that this country
has seen in a long time, not even excepting
the marriage of Miss Consuelo Vanderbilt
to the young Duke of Marlborough, or the
gorgeous affair which marked the wedding
cf Miss Anna Gould and the Count de
Castellane.
AN AMERICAN TROUSSEAU.
None of the details of the forthcoming
marriage have yet been given out, for the
reason that everything is still unajronged.
Tiae young people are anxious to submit
everything for the approval of Mr. Vander
bilt, and as he has been too ill to discuss
things on Long Island, humbled him. He
surrounded his estate with a six foot wire
fence at a cost of $2,000. and the day after
it was built he gave orders to tear it. down
because the members of the Meadowbrook
Hunt Club threatened him with social ex
tinction. Mr. Vanderbilt will build a town house
for the young people somewhere in the
neighborhood of Fifth avenue and Fifty
seventh street. New York, the location of
both the Whitney and Vanderbilt town
houses.
The Rev. Dr. David H. Greer, of St.
Bartholomew's Church, on Madison avenue.
New York, will be the officiating minister
at th3 wedding. Miss Vanderbilt has at
tended his church for many years and has
been a liberal giver to all of its charities.

The last heard of Dyche was at Seattle,
where it was said he was to sail for the
North. He was to go through Behring
Strait and the Northwest passage to Green
land. This is a much longer route than
that taken by Peary, but as the Kansas man
had a start of nearly two weeks, this should
even things up.
A year ago Professor Dyche said that he
was going to try and reach the North Pole
this summer, and it may be that after dis
posing of the meteorite he will push on to
the North. He is not a rich man, and
could not afford to defray the expense of
such a journey, but It is well known that
a number of wealthy men have stood ready
for years to supply the money be would re
quire for a trio.
THE PRIZE METEORITE.
Some -time ago when talking about the
meteorite Professor Dyche said: ""This
meteorite was first seen by Franklin, to
whom the natives showed it. The Esqui
maux have known it for ages. They call
it the 'great iron stone.' It weighs forty
tons and is composed of solid iron mixed
with a little nickel. It probably fell out
of the heavens centuries ago and has lain
among the rocks on that inhospitable coast,
seen by only a few men.
""When the Kite, on which I went after
Peary, was returning, the Esquimaux told
us repeatedly of the 'great iron stone,' and
prevailed upon us to stop and see it. Peary
and I saw it at the same time, but Peary
claimed it for himself by 'rightof discovery.'
""I do net know of any law by which he
tan claim it over me or any other man
who will take the trouble to go after it. I
received a letter from Lieutenant Peary a
day or two ago in which he warns me that
the meteorite is his, and that he is going
to go after it in a ship in the spring. I
understand a syndicate in Chicago is also
thinking of outfitting a ship to go after it.
If I should take a notion that I wanted it,
and my ship was the first to reach there, I
don't think anyone would prevent my taking
it.
""It is a peculiar grayish bit of metal,
lying half out of the ground. It is very
hard. We found it impossible to break a
piece from it with cold chisels and sledges.
We managed to bore a hole in it for a short
distance, after wearing out several cold bits.
into their respective strides and each has a
handshake of his own. Major McKinley has
been shaking hands with the nation for
some years past and it was an easy matter
for him to meet the great tidal wave of
outstretched palms.
The political handshake, particularly the
national political handshake, is a very dif
ferent thing from the ordinary business, or
eociai greeting. - Most people don't kno
hold him firmly. This gives the candidate
a distinct advantage, and the practical
joker, who has a grip like a steel vise. Is
balked in his endeavor to crush the bones
of the smiling candidate. This brand of
the practical joker seems to make it a
business to shake the hands of great men
just for the pleasure of seeing them wince
under mighty pressure. But the up-to-date
statesmen have foiled them by adopt-
this. If McKinley, Bryan, Sewall or Hobart j ing the candidate's grip.
shook hands like ordinary people their fists
would be a shapeless mass inside of a week.

only on particular people, and its effective
ness cannot be magnified. When a visitor
approaches, Mr. Bryan throws back his
broad shoulders, takes a step forward, and
before the caller knows it his hand is being
vigorously shaken by the candidate. If the
visitor happens to be of unusual note, or an
old friend, Mr. Bryan places his left hand
on top of the visitor's right, or if the caller
be a person of exceptional prominence the
candidate reaches out his left hand and
catches the left hand of the other, and then
works both arms like the piston rods of a
twin screw steamship.
M'KINLEY'S SURPRISE.
Major McKinley is less enthusiastic, but
his handshake is a surprise to most peo
ple. It begins in a passive, lifeless sort
of a way, but it ends like a climax in an
old-fashioned melodrama. The Major is
sternly opposed to the new style of hand
shake which requires the lifting of the
hand as high as the head. He always ex
tends his hand on a straight line from the
fourth button of his waistcoat and is quick
to grasp the visitor's fingers. He raises
his arm slowly about half a foot and then,
when the caller thinks it Is time to break
loose, tbe Major jumps up and down with
surprising energy, accompanying tbe final
pump with a squeeze of the fingers, which
makes the arm tingle up to the elbow.
Then the Maji r bows gently and is ready
for the-next comer. If the visitor happens
to be a lady the process is the same ex
cept that the squeeze is modified to a
gentle pressure. Ladies who have Just
passed under the benign influence of a
handshake with the Major have been,
heard to remark: ""Isn't he just awfully
deferential?""
Arthur Sewall, of Maine, has much to
learn in the political handshaking line. He
is naturally abrupt and terse, avoiding
the delivery and reception of cheap plat
itudes as much as possible. He has Dot
yet rid himself of the business idea that
when some one comes to see him it is for
some purpose other than the mere formal
ity of shaking hands with him. But he is
able to identify members of this class at
a glance, and he passes them along quick
ly with a powerful grasp of the hand and
a ""How do? How are you?""
Mr. Hobart is !e3s abrupt. He shakes
hands in a way so much like Major Mc
Kinley that some people say that he either
took lessons from the Ohio statesman or
that he spent many hours in studying the
latter's system. The slow beginning and
the exciting finish are the same, and even
the gender graded pressure is met with.
Two charming dust cloaks covering th
pretty toilets worn at a suburban wedding
were, one of chamois-colored silk, with pleat
inss of white taffeta let in the skirt seam,
and white siik ruches finishing the throat
band and wrists of the big bishop sleeves.
The other cloak was of brown Holland com
pletely covered with fine white soutache braid
aewed on in irregular waving lines. It had a
white satin shell collar and cuffs to the bish
op sleeves, a Princess back, and Russia
blouse irout, girdle with jade and old silvw.

Development of Sensitive
' - Method Reported by
* : · »
German Physicist.
BY THOMAS R. HENRY.
The age of meteorites now cân be
measur%d.
Development of an extraordinarily
sensitive method for this hitherto im
possible measurement has just been re
ported by Prof. F Pancth, German
physicist, to the Committee on the
Measurement of Geological Time of the
National Research Council.
Applying his method to samples of
these celestial visitors, collected all over
the wond, including several from the
United States, Prof. Paneth finds that
the oldest cannot boast of more than
3,000,000,000 years, which is well within
the time since the formation of the
solar system. This leads to the conjec
ture that they are parts of the solar
system. -,
The method reported by Prof. Paneth
has far-reaching applications to other
time-measurement problems upon which
the American committee is at work,
especially the determination of the age
of deposits of copper, silver and other
metals which are very faintly radio
active! It consists in determination of
the amount of rare gas helium, product
of atotnic disintegration, in a given
amount ot the metal.
Supplants Lead Method.
Hitherto the most reliable method of
measuring geological time has been by
the lead-ratio method. The two radio
active elements, uranium and thorium,
disintegrate at a fixed rate into a final
state which is a form of lead differing
in atomic weight from ordinary lead.
The amount of lead in proportion to
these parent elements in a sample of a
deposit is a measure of its age. Helium
Is one of the by-products of the disin
tegration. It is, however, a light gas
■which will not enter into chemical com
bination with anything in nature, and
which, consequently, escapes easily and
becomes diffused in the atmosphere.
Lead, the heavy metal, ""stays put."" In
the past measurements of the helium
content has given much lower figures
iof the age of a deposit than the lead
method.
The advantage of the helium meas
urement is that this element can be
determined in much smaller quantities.
The geologist using ihe lead-ratio
method can consider only the special
kind of lead which results from atomic
disintegration, and in small samples it
is impossible to distinguish this accu
rately from ordinary lead, which has
not time significance.
""Hitherto,"" says Prof. Paneth. ""the
lead method has been almost exclu
sively recognized as reliable. There
are. however, materials which hold the
helium completely fast—the metals.
Even by heating an iron meteorite to
1,000 degrees tor many hours only a
negligibly small fraction of the helium
is dissipated, obviously only that close
to the surface. We can therefore as
su ma with certainty that the amount
of hélium which has been formed since
the èotnsôlidation of the meteorite still
is completely inclos:?. Only the helium
irom.tfce ring may have escaped.
Acoqr»cy Increased.
""Hate the helium is just as reliable
as tha lend method, over which it has
some advantages, and we are In a posi
tion tt> test for helium in small quan
tities. ' Iron meteorites contain helium
only A the order of a hundred-thou
sandth· to a millionth of a cubi; centl
met;r g··. By a spécial method
of dissolving the meteorite away from
air we can measure a millionth of a
cubic centimeter of helium with a max
imum error of 1 per cent. By using
several grams of a meteorite it is always
possible |p increase the accuracy of the
helium measurements in proportion.
""The 100,000,000th to the 10,000,000,
000th part to a gram of lead, formed
according' to the laws of radio-activity
by the same decomposition, cannot be
recognized, in the presence of a much
larger amount of normal lead present
in the meteorites, for one contains on
the averagft an amount to which the
lead isotopfc formed by the decomposi
tion of uranium and theorium would
not be even one part per thousand.
""It appears that to determine the age
οt iron meteorites the helium method
Is the only way yet applicable, and the
customary objection of the possible es
cape of helium does not apply. What
applies to iron meteorites also applies
to native metals. It is probable that
the error from the escape of helium
becomes important only in the radio
active minerals which contain much
helium, to which investigation hitherto
has been confined.
""For the iron meteorites we have
estimates of age for which there is still
an uncertainty, because they give us
maximum values, but the particular In
terest is in the maximum age, because
before all it must be decided whether
the age of the meteorite is not too
great to consider It as belonging-to our
planetary system. The highest age yet
ascertained seems to be not above
8.000,000.000, which is within the time
since the formation of the solar
aystem.""
RESTRICTION PLACED
or' CIRCUSES IN D. C.
Consent of More Residents of Areas
Adjoining: the Sites Is
Now Necessary.
Before circuses and carnivals can be
Staged hereafter in the District, the
consent of more residents of the areas
adjoining the sites will have to be
obtained, under an amendment to the
police regulations wiopted yesterday by
the District Commissioners.
Acting in response to protests filed
by residents located near the grounds
of a recent carnival, the Commissioners
increased the area from which consent
must be obtained by promoters of the
attractions and also specified that
consent be obtained from property
owners as well a;; occupants of the
properties.
Under the amer.ded regulation the
written consent of three-fourths of the
occupants and owners of the premises
■within 500 feet of the site of the
attraction must be obtained. The rule
previously applied to residents living
within 300 feet.
PERMIT IS AUTHORIZED
FOR PANTHEON SIGN
fl5. C. Commissioners Approve Ap
plication *n Behalf of
War Painting.
An application by the Pantheon
Corporation for a permit for erection
of a sign on its exhibition building, at
New Jersey avenue and C streets, adver
tising its showing of the huge World
War painting, Pantheon de la Guerre,
was approved yesterday by the District
Commissioners, after the size of the
proposed sign had been reduced dras
tically.
The application called for permission
to erect a sign, approximately 1,1S2
square feet in area, which had the
approval of the Pine Arts Commission.
The Commissionners, however, acting
on a recommendation by Capt. Hugh P.
Oram, director of inspection, specified
that the area of the sign be not more
than 200 square feet.
A hypothetical ouestion which took
87 minutes to propound was asked a

You probably realize that halitosis (un
pleasant breath) is the unforgivable social
fault, and take precautions against it.
But are you taking the right precaution?
Are you sure the mouth wash you use can
cure halitosis? How do you know that it
possesses any deodorant effect whatever?
What evidence have you that you are not
throwing your money away on question
able mouth washes with little or no deodor
ant power? There are hundreds on the
market.
For your own sake
When you want to be sure that your breath
is sweet, wholesome, and agreeable, use
Listerine—and Listerine only. It is the
quickest of deodorants, the swiftest of
antiseptics.
Its deodorant effect is a matter of scien
tific record with physicians, surgeons, and
nurses. Because of its remarkable deodor
ant properties, Listerine has been specified
in the treatment of suppurating wounds
for the past 50 years.
Sweetens breath instantly
Clinical tests now show that Listerine,
used as a mouth wash, instantly over
comes odors that ordinary antiseptics can
not hide in 12 hours.
A second series of tests against the onion
odor revealed even more startling superi
ority. While Listerine overcame the odor
almost immediately, the other mouth wash
advertised as being effective in dilutions
of three to one, could not hide the onion
odor in 24 hours.
When you buy a mouth wash, in the
hope of keeping your mouth clean and
fresh, and your breath sweet and agreeable,
don't gamble with solutions without repu
tation or record of performance.
Ask for Listerine... the antiseptic mouth
wash you can depend upon, Lambert Phar

Md. U. Scientist Tells
Os Planet Debris 'Rain'
By THOMAS B. HENRY
Science Editor o< The Bier
TORONTO, Sept. 14.—Debris of three small planets of the
solar system which crashed together about 300 million years
ago still Is raining on earth, sometimes in big chunks which
cause enormous craters.
This was proposed as the origin of all the iron, nickel and
stony meteorites now falling by Dr. S. P. Singer of the University
of Maryland before the Inter
national Union of Geodesy and
Geophysics here.
Many of the fragments are
burned by air friction if they
approach the earth but, it was
brought out in a meteorite sym
posium. A least one a day prob
ably hits the ground. The
largest ones found appear to
be made up of units, as if
smaller fragments of the de
stroyed planets had started to
coalesce in outer space to build
up new planetoid bodies but
had struck the earth before
the process had proceeded very
far.
For some of the craters
found to date the crash, of an
object weighing several hun
dreds of tons would be neces
sary. An outer limit of a
billion tons was placed on an
object with any probability of
smashing into the earth. If
this ever happened it probably
would be the greatest catas
trophe of all time since the
energy of impact of such a
body, moving through space
at about 40 miles a second,
would be equivalent to the
explosion of 2,000 times the
same amount of TNT. Com
pared to it the blast of thou
sands of hydrogen bombs
would be a trivial thing.
Two Types of Visitors
There are two types of
visitors from the space of the
solar system, said Dr. Peter
Mlllman of the Canadian Na
tional Research Council. First
are those observed as “shoot
ing stars.” The bits are small
and composed of an exceed
ingly fragile material. Their
density is less than a 20th
that of water. A count con
ducted by Dr. Mlllman showed
that at least 200 million a day
large enough to be seen with
a small telescope rain into the
earth’s atmosphere. There
probably are many times as
many below the limit of visi
bility.
These objects appear to be
fragments of a comet. Dr.
Mlllman said, since their orbits
around the sun are ./essentially
like those of comets rather
than minor planets. The sub
stance of comets is known to
be extremely light and fragile.
The larger objects which ac
tually strike the earth, how
ever. must have been formed
in the hot Interior of some
larger body. Subjection to great
pressures and heats is shown
by their crystal structure.
Their paths around the sun Is
that of known small plants.
Crashes in Our Time
Within our own times, Dr.
Millman explained, there have
been two crashes of medium
heavy objects of this class with
the earth. Both have been In
almost inaccessible parts of
Northern Siberia. In the past,
however, Northern Canada
seems to have been a favorite
impact place. Five probable
meteorite praters, quite similar
to those which pock-mark the
face of the moon, have been
found by Canadian geologists
in the past few years. They
also have located eight other
circular features varying from
a few hundred yards to 400
miles In diameter which in all
probability are ancient craters.
The 400-mile one is known
from air photographs. It is in

an almost inaccessible region
on the east side of Hudson Bay.
If the interpretation is correct
it must have been result of the
most terrific impact ever suf
fered by the earth. It is. how
ever, only a semicircle. Half
has been inundated, or other
wise obliterated.
The increased number of sixe
of known meteorite craters,
fold Dr. C. S. Beals of the
Dominion Observatory, and
their resemblance to the fea
tures of the moon's surface In
dicate that meteorite impact
may. have been one of the im
portant factors in shaping the
large scale topography of the
earth. He urged Intensive stud
ies of air photographs all over
the world to discover more such
craters.
Blast Which Hit Moon
Any chunk which may have
hit the earth, it was stressed,
hardly can have weighed more
than a few million tons. Ap
parently, however, one weighing
a billion tons once struck the
moon before that body had en
tirely lost Its atmosphere. The
remains of the crash are repre-

But Lag Behind Seven States
Washington (and its visitors)
and an epic thirst for beer last
year, but it was rushing an empty
growler compared to seven other
places, including li’l ol’ Rhode
i Island.
The staggering truth on the
Nation’s beer consumption, pro
duction, taxation and related
statistics was out today in the
Brewers’ Almanac.
Issued by the United States
Brewers’ Foundation, Inc., the
116-page beer Baedeker shows the
District’s malt beverage consump
tion last year was 22.7 gallons per
person.
Maryland, which was a lot
thirster in 1944, was still con
suming 23.4 gallons per capita in
1950, but the average Virginian
put away only 10.1 gallons.
Wisconsin, which has consist
ently produced more beer than
any other State since its legaliza
tion in 1934, also had a corre
sponding thirst. The State had
a per capita consumption of 27.5
to lead the Nation.
Wisconsin has never been under
21 gallons per person siftce 1941
and in 1946, a pretty good year
all around, was pouring It down
at 29.5 gallons per person.
Second to dairyland at the
1950 beer taps was Michigan, with
24.7 gallons per person. Other
States, down to the District's 22.7
figure were:
Rhode Island, 24.2 gallons; New
Hampshire and Maryland, 23.4
gallons; Nevada, 23.3 gallons, and
New York, 23.1.
The Almanac’s historical sec
tion observes that brewing ante
dates the Pyramids, but it isn’t
catching on very fast in Alabama.
The 1950 per capita consump
tion there was 4.3 gallons.
U. S. Warns Those Making Wine
At Home of Its Regulations
A lot of home vintners had bet
ter watch their step and familiar
ize themselves with regulations,
the Treasury Department cau
tioned yesterday.
To avoid the risk of incurring
criminal and tax liabilities, per
sons authorized to produce wines
for their family use were warned
to file Form 1541, in duplicate, at
least five days before they start
making wine at home. The In
ternal Revenue Bureau is very
touchy on this score.
In this area. Form 1541 is ob
tainable from the District Super
visor, Alcohol Tax Unit, 103 South
Gay street, Baltimore 2, Md. The
law provides that a married man,
residing with his family, or a single
person the head of a family, may
make up to 200 gallons of wine if
he registers with the Alcohol Tax
Unit. Then he won’t have to pay
a tax if he gets oil the “authorized”
list.
There are some “don’ts” at
tached to this authorization. For
instance, don’t sell or remove a
drop of it from the premises with
out first obtaining permission from
District Supervisor R. E. Tuttle of
the Baltimore office. Also must be
for family use exclusively and may
not be removed from the premises
unless Jhe maker is relocating his
legal domicile.
Be sure also to file a new cer
tificate each year on or after
July 1.
All these forms being observed,
the Treasury suggests, fermenting
wine for home use may become a
respectable and legal pursuit.
Expedition to Study Mystery
Behind Giant Canadian Crater
By th« Associated Press
A great mystery of nature may
be solved soon by an expedition
getting underway in Canada this
week.
The mystery is this:
What force ripped a hole in the
earth so large Jhat an estimated!
5 billion tons of granite were blown
out and scattered over the coun
tryside?
Dr. Victor Ben Meen of Toronto,
expedition leader, is convinced the
great crater is not a dead volcano.
Likewise, he doesn’t believe it could
have been caused by a glacier.
The most widely accepted theory
is that a giant object from outer
space, a meteorite, struck this re
mote comer of Canada between
Hudson Bay and Ungava Bay.
Crater Two Miles Wide.
If the expedition is able to prove
this it will label the Canadian
crater the greatest of its kind ever
found on earth.
Dr. Meen visited the site last
year and found the crater to be
two miles wide and hundreds of
feet deep, tom out by a force that
must have equaled that of m-ny
atomic bombs.
The largest known hole caused
by a meteorite is Canyon Diablo
Crater in Arizona, four-fifths of a
mile across.
When Dr. Meen visited the Ca
nadian site he was unable to find
any fragments of stone or metal
that may have come from an ex
ploding meteor.
This year the expedition will
use mine detectors and other
metal-detecting devices in a hunt
for fragments.
If the meteorite was of stone,
and lacked any metallic content,
these metal-detecting instruments
will be of little value.
Lake’s Depth Unknown.
But the scientists plan to drill
into the bottom of an icy lake
that has formed in the crater.
How deep this lake, and the
crater, may be is unknown. If
"" ^====
i large parts of a stone meteorite
are buried under the lake it may
be located by drilling.
No large meteorite ever has been
discovered in the Arizona crater,
but there are many fragments.
One theory has been that the on
rushing object exploded with tre
mendous force when it struck the
earth, leaving only fragments.
The Canadian expedition will
be sponsored by the Toronto Royal
Ontario Museum and the National
Geographic Society. Dr. Meen is
the museum director.

President Tells What He Wants Congress to Do—Mussolini
Tries Another Restoration Method —Senate’s
Tax-Boosting Bill.
By EDWARD
DRESIDEN’T ROOSEVELT, in n
*■ series of conferences with congres
sional leaders, made known his de
sires in the way of Immediate legisla
tion. First, he told
them he would soon
submit a new request
for $1,500,000,000 for
relief purposes, as
was Indicated in his
January budget mes
sage. This bill will
Include several pro
visions namely, a
housing program and
$500,000,000 for the
public works program
President t 0 a j(j employment
Roosevelt The relief will be
made a part of the usual deficiency
measure.
Next, Mr. Roosevelt wants a stock
market regulation bill with better
teeth than those in the much modified
Fletcher-Rayburn measure. He de
sires, too, passage of reciprocal tariff,
general revenue, municipal bank
ruptcy, and federal insurance on bank
deposits measures.
In order that congress may get
through and adjourn by the middle of
May, the President is willing to side
track some of the administration
measures, including the permanent air
mail legislation and the Wagner
bill to eliminate company-dominated
unions. He was reported also to have
expressed opposition to measures to
create a central monetary authority.
The house, it is said, will be ready
to adjourn by May 15, but there is
doubt whether the senate will get
through its work before June 1.
PREMIER MUSSOLINI of Italy has
his own ideas of the way to restore
prosperity, and they are utterly at
variance with those of President
Roosevelt. By his direction the coun
cil of ministers issued a series of de
cree laws designed to make the cost
of living commensurate with the pur
chasing power of the lira.
The Italian lira now stands at 3 to 1
In purchasing power with reference to
pre-war values, Il Duce declared. The
cost of living on the other hand is
4 to 1 with ref erence to pre-war prices.
The two will be equalized, Mussolini
and his ministers declared, and here
is what they did:
Slashed the pay of members of the
government 20 per cent.
Cut the pay of state and public em
ployees on a scale ranging from 6 to
12 per cent.
Slashed various supplements and
indemnities granted state employees
and others from 10 to 50 per cent.
Ordered every landlord in Italy to
reduce rents by 12 per cent in cases
of individuals and societies, and 15
per cent in case of businesses and
shops.
Reduced prices in co-operative
stores and military co-operatives by
10 per cent
President Roosevelt is right, not
Mussolini, said the London Sunday Ex
press in an editorial.
“Mussolini cuts all food prices and
rents on all dwellings,” the paper
pointed out “He cuts, too, state sal
aries in excess of £2 ($10) a week.
Roosevelt works the opposite way by
raising wages and prices all around.
Mussolini wants to reduce the cost of
living. Roosevelt seeks to increase
purchasing power.”
CERTAIN tax increases written into
the tax bill by the senate and
passed by that body are regarded by
house leaders as quite undesirable.
Chairman Doughton of the ways and
means committee declared they were
entirely outside the original intent of
the new revenue legislation, and a
fight against them was planned in con
ference.
When the measure reached the sen
ate it contained provisions estimated
to produce $258,000,000 a year in new
revenue, chiefly by stopping the loop
holes through which legal tax avoid
ance had been possible.
The bill fell quickly into the hands
of the senate “liberal” element, and
provisions were inserted to add $220,-
000,000 to the yield provided by the
house. Also, the senate inserted the
provision for publicity of all income
tax returns, which has been proposed
many times but usually knocked out
before final enactment.
* I 'HE world wheat advisory commis
sion, sitting in Rome, reached the
first international agreement for price
stabilization and urged the govern
ments represented to adopt it before
May 1, when a committee of experts
will meet in London to put the price
system into operation.
Four men with wide powers will be
designated, under the agreement, to
sit in London and control the world
movement of wheat Quotas will be
granted and prices will be raised or
lowered in the various countries as
far as exports are concerned, accord
ing to quota shipments.
Sales below or above quotas will
govern the increase or reduction in
prices. The advisory commission con
siders this to be a good method of
controlling quotas through prices. It
was officially announced the minimum
price plan supplements the London
wheat agreement

A history to limit a crop was sent
to the White House for approval after
the house agreed to the senate altera

ers. Most radical so far of the New

per cent upon all cotton ginned in ex
cess of that figure. The secretary of
agriculture is to apportion to each
farmer, through his agents, the amount
of cotton he may grow.
CONDEMNATION and seizure of pri
vate property in the interest of the
administration's great housing pro
gram has been begun in Atlanta, Ga.
Secretary Ickes, acting as Public
Works administrator, asked Attorney
General Cummings to file condemna
tion proceedings against 134 parcels of
land there in the name of the Federal
Emergency Housing corporation. In
addition to these parcels the govern
ment is buying outright 70,000 square
feet of land to complete what is need
ed for a $2,000,000 housing plan for
negroes.
It was indicated that similar action
in connection with housing plans will
be taken in Chicago and other cities.
Condemnation proceedings are to be
resorted to only to expedite the pro
gram, says Mr. Ickes, and the govern
ment is willing to pay a fair price at
all times.
JOHN J. BLAINE, for years one of
the prominent political figures in
Wisconsin, former governor of that
state and also United States senator,
died of pneumonia at his home in Bos
cobel. He was one of the La Follette
group of independent Republicans and
was defeated for renomination to the
senate in 1932 by John B. Chapple,
who was beaten in the election by F.
Ryan Duffy. At the time of his death
Mr. Blaine was a director of the Re
construction Finance corporation.
M ALFALFA BILL” MURRAY
governor of Oklahoma, doesn’t
propose to permit resales of property
for delinquent taxes in his state.
These sales were
scheduled in eleven
counties, six others
having already
called them off. The
governor called out
his ever-ready Na
tional Guard, declar
ing that “protection
for the homes of the
people in stressful
times like these is a
.. vital policy tran-
Gov. urray S cending any tem
porary loss in taxes.” He ordered the
arrest of any county official who at
tempted to conduct a delinquent-tax
sale.
The counties to which guardsmen
were sent are scattered. In most coun
ties the military department consisted
of an officer and three men. Adjutant
General Barrett said a greater number
was not sent for economic reasons, but
added that “more troops will be ready’
to go if necessary.”
TWO court victories were won by
the AAA in one day. In Chicago
Federal Judge W. H. Holley upheld the
right of the AAA to regulate the milk
industry by means of set prices at
which all milk must be purchased from
farmers. This was in accord with oth
er recent decisions.
In New Orleans the United States
Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals dis
solved an interlocutory Injunction is
sued against an agency of the Agricul
tural Adjustment administration, and
in its opinion described the AAA mar
keting agreement for Florida citrus
growers as being “legal.” Without
directly passing on the question of
constitutionality of the agricultural ad
justment act, which had been raised
in the lower court, the Circuit judges
said: “The act provides that such
(marketing) agreements shall be law
ful, notwithstanding the anti-trust
laws. The validity of that provision
is not assailed, and so the marketing
agreement, being legal, is enforceable,
even though other provisions of the
act may be invalid.”
JUST before he left Washington for
Miami to meet the President and
accompany him back to the Capital,
General Johnson decreed a radical re
organization of the
NRA along lines sim
ilar to those of the
army. The most im
portant part of this
shakeup was the ap
pointment of Lieut
Col. G. A. Lynch, an
infantry officer of the
regular army, as John-
son’s right-hand man.
Colonel Lynch, whom
the administrator de- . w _ .
scribes as “the most Col. G. A. Lynch
advanced thinker in the United States
army,” is given full jurisdiction over
all matters not otherwise assigned.
He has complete authority to approve
codes, orders, amendments and other
modifications, and may sign codes that
do not require the signature of the
President. The NRA administration
no longer will be a one-man affair, and
Indeed, the ground is now laid for the
retirement of General Johnson, which
has been predicted for some time.
D EDUCTION of passenger rates in
the South and West proved to be
a goose that laid many golden eggs
for the railroads in those regions, but
now the NRA, which has no control
over the railways, is trying to per
suade the Interstate Commerce com
mission to kill the goose because the
bus operators are complaining. A
hearing has been called tn Washing
ton for April 23 and the bus opera
tors, the railway officials and the pub-
Us will be heard. The first named
propose that the railroads raise coach
rates to 2 cents and pullman rates to
3 cents and that the motor bus code
be changed to halt special excursion
rates and chartering of buses. Most
of the railroads are willing to do this.
CTENIO VINCENT, president of
Haiti, arrived in Washington to
tell President Roosevelt about the
troubles of the little republic and was
the guest of the government for three
days. He was entertained at luncheon
in the White House and pleaded with
the President for the removal of
American control over Haitian finance
when the American marines are with
drawn in October. Mrs. Roosevelt al
ready knew Mr. Vincent for she called
on him in Port-au-Prince when she
visited Haiti by plane recently on her
way back from Puerto Rico.
Dr. WILLIAM A. WIRT, the really
eminent educator of Gary, Ind.,
told his story of a ‘‘red plot"" to over

the affair, asserted that gag rule had
been enforced.

The revelation of the alleged scheme
of the radicals, said Wirt, came to him
at a dinner given by Miss Alice Bar
rows at a country house near Wash
ington. The other guests were Robert
Bruere, David C. Coyle, Miss Hilde
garde Kneeland and Miss Mary Tay
lor, all, like the hostess, connected with
the government, and Lawrence Todd,
chief of the Tass, official Soviet gov
ernment new’s agency in the United
States. From their conversation, Wirt
said, he gathered that men high in the
councils of the administration were
plotting the overthrow of the Ameri
can social order and that they con
sidered President Roosevelt as an
other Kerensky to be followed by an
other Stalin. The six men named by
Wirt were Secretary of Agriculture
Henry A. Wallace; Prof. Rexford Guy
Tugwell, assistant secretary of agri
culture and recognized head of the
brain trust; Prof. Milburn L. Wilson,
head of the subsistence homestead di
vision of the Department of Interior;
Dr. Robert Kohn, head of the housing
division of the public works adminis
tration ; Dr. Frederick Howe, consum
ers’ counsel for the agricultural ad
justment administration, and Henry T.
Rainey, speaker of the house of repre
sentatives.
The most serious charges made by
the gentleman from Indiana were di
rected at Professor Tugwell; but his
basis for these, as for practically all
of his story, was hearsay, second-hand
information and vague statements by
some of his fellow guests at the din
ner. In that lay its weakness, though
there are many serious-minded Ameri
cans who insist that there should be
a real investigation of any govern
ment officials seeking to undermine
the present form of government.
The committee, having heard Wirt,
adjourned for some days with the in
tention of calling as witnesses those
who attended the country house din
ner. Some of them already had denied
flatly or belittled the statements made
by Wirt. Chairman Bulwinkle of the
committee intimated that there was
no Intention of summoning the “higher
ups” named by Wirt, or anyone else;
so it seemed likely the whole inquiry
would fizzle out
LOTS of bickering resulted from the
Wirt case, and in this some of
the Democrats concerned did not make
a good showing. Chairman Bulwinkle
of the committee, for instance, as
serted that Wirt was imprisoned at
Gary during war times for pro-Ger
man activities. Later on Mr. Bul
winkle retracted this charge and made
an apology in a speech before the
house. Secretary of the Interior Ickes
accused Doctor Wirt of having sought
to obtain public works money
for a “Fairyland” project in the In
diana dunes by which Doctor Wirt
was to sell 2,000 front feet of dune
land along Lake Michigan at SSO a
foot, a total sale price of SIOO,OOO.
The project was disapproved by the
Public Works administration as “vi
sionary and impractical,” Ickes said.
Doctor Wirt issued a denial of Sec
retary Ickes’ tale, explaining that he
had no connection with the proposed
project and that the company with
which he was connected had held the
land in question for 12 years to pre
serve it for park purposes.
SAMUEL INSULL, fallen utilities
magnate, is on his way home to
be tried for his alleged misdoings in
connection with the bankruptcy of his
financial empire. Turned over to the
American authorities by the Turkish
government, he was taken from Istan
bul by coastal steamer and train to
Smyrna and there put aboard the
American export liner Exilona. He is
due to land in New York about May 20.
Burton Y. Berry, third secretary of
the American embassy at Istanbul, was
designated to accompany Insull on the
trip to the United States.
IF HENRY A. WALLACE has his
way, Arthur W. Cutten, millionaire
member of the Chicago wheat pit, will
be barred from future trading on grain
exchanges. The secretary of agricul
ture summoned Cutten to appear be
fore the Grain Futures administration
In Chicago on May 14 to answer
charges of failing to report his trades,
as required by the grain futures act,
with making false reports, and with
concealing his trades through false en
tries, dummy accounts and other col
lusive practices. The alleged offenses
were committed in 1930 and 1931.
BECAUSE of reports that Colombia
had hired 24 American aviators
and seeking to give contracts to
50 more through its consul general in
New York, the Department of State
issued a notice saying:
“The United States disapproves of
American citizens taking service in
the armed forces of any foreign gov
ernment and, if Americans do so, it is
on their sole responsibility and risk
and they cannot look to their govern
ment for protection while in such
services.”

THE ELY MINER. ELY. MINN.
U
9 ILL the autumn of 1934 see the earth
bombarded with a shower of meteors
or “falling stars,” a spectacular dis
play of “Nature’s fireworks” which
will put to shame the most ambi
tious pyrotechnical effort that the
mind of man could possibly devise?
Astronomers believe there Is a chance
that it will. For, according to their
calculations, such a display is at least
a year overdue. Here Is the reason:
On the nights of November 12 and
13, 1833, the world was visited with the greatest
shower of meteors of which there is any certain
record. All along the eastern seaboard of the
United States people looked up at a sky that
was literally aflame with “falling stars,” many
of them as brilliant as the most brilliant “fixed
star’’ in the firmament “The stars fell on this
occasion like flakes of snow” one observer has
recorded, “and it was calculated that at least
240,000 of them had fallen during a period of
nine hours.”
Then people began to recall that exactly on
the same date in 1799 —34 years earlier—there
had been a similar shower of “falling stars.”
Again in 1860 there was a great shower and in
1867, one only slightly less spectacular than the
preceding year. Perhaps it was only coincidence
that these showers had come at 33 or 34 year
intervals or perhaps it was another manifesta
tion of the regularity of Nature. At any rate,
the astronomers looked for another shower in
1899, but it failed to materialize. Neither did it
come the next year. Evidently the 33 or 34-year
period had been skipped entirely.
Still undaunted by the failure of the Leonids
(for that is the scientific name of these “fall
ing stars”) to appear on schedule time in 1899,
the astronomers eyed the heavens hopefully on
November 12 and 13, 1932. But once more they
were disappointed, as they were again last year.
But some of them still think that this coming
November may see the display of “Nature’s fire
works” similar to those of the years mentioned
above. What has happened to these showers of
meteors at periods of one-third of a century?
Nobody knows. The disappearance of the Leonids
is one of the mysteries of science.
Meteors, except as they come in showers like
the Leonids, are not at all uncommon. There
is never a clear, moonless night when you can
not step outside your house and see several of
them in the course of 15 minutes. The most of
them, of course, are very small—mere little wisps
of light that shoot across the heavens. But now
and then you may see a much brighter one. At
times, though not many of us will have the luck
to see It, one comes with a thunderous noise
like the roar of a cannonade, and a brilliance
that blinds the eyes.
What are these fiery travelers through our
heavens? Men used to think that they were actu
ally stars broken loose from their moorings.
Probably there are still many men who hold to
some such belief, but it is very far from true.
The stars are great suns, many of them vastly
larger than our own sun, and millions upon mil
lions of miles distant from our solar system.
Meteors are the fiery display of stones, captured
out of space by the gravitation of the earth,
and heated to Incandescence by the friction of
the air that blankets our globe. These stones
pierce our atmosphere at almost emthlnkable
speeds, ranging from 28,000 to 160,000 miles per
hour. .
What becomes of them? They do not pelt the
ground around us? No, the most of them are
burned to ashes while still many miles above
us. Every now and then, however, one that is
too large to burn up before it hits the ground
does come. Such stones are called meteorites,
and many thousands of them, weighing from
several ounces to several tons, are on exhibit in
our museums.
Anyone especially farmers may happen
upon a meteorite. Prof. Harvey H. Nlninger of
the Colorado Museum of Natural History in Den
ver, who is the world’s greatest authority on
the subject, says that there is probably not an
area ten miles aquare anywhere in the United
States, where at least one stone from the sky
is not waiting to be found. It may be under the
ground, especially if it is a large one, or it may
be out in plain sight.
His conjecture is based on wide experience,
for he has himself collected more than 1,500 of
them during the past ten years. His specimens
may be seen in almost every large' museum in
the world: in London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna; in
the Field museum in Chicago, tn the Smithsonian
Institution In Washington, in the Museum of Nat
ural History In New York City; and In many
others. No other man has collected even one
tenth as many as he has. The most of Professor
Nlnlnger’s stones have been bought from farmers
who turned them up while plowing, or who found
them in tramps across fields and pastures.
They are easy to recognize, when one knows
what to look for. Most meteorites are one of
two kinds: iron meteorites or stony meteorites.
The “Irons” are always black on the outside,
when newly fallen; but when one has lain ex
posed to the air for a time, it will probably be
reddish-brown with rust. In either case, of
course, it will be very heavy. Often, but not
always, it will have peculiar pits in it, somewhat
like a piece of putty into which somebody has
pushed his thumbs and fingers. Any strange
piece of iron, which isn’t clearly of some other
origin, may possibly be a meteorite.
Stony meteorites are a bit harder to identify.
They, too, are always heavier than the average
earth stone; and also they are always black on
the outside when newly fallen, turning to red
dish-brown in the course of time. Inside, how
ever, they differ greatly from iron meteorites
and also from one another. One common kind
looks very much like a piece of grayish-white
cement, covered with a coat of black paint; or,
if it is an old fall, of black paint mixed with
rusty brown. Another kind is quite black Inside.
Indeed, they may be almost any shade between
black and white under their outer crust
Stony meteorites are also often pitted, but the
pits are seldom as sharply defined as they are
in the iron variety. After the surface has turned
from black to reddlsh-browp, it often looks a
good deal like the crust of a loaf of cracked
wheat bread, with similar little flakes scattered

which fell near the present site of Winslow,
Ariz., some time before the white man came in
to that country. It is almost a mile across and
600 feet deep. The meteorite, weighing several
million tons, is buried more than 1,500 feet be
low the level of the desert. (Photograph by

2. Prof. Harvey Nininger of the Colorado
Museum of Natural History examining the Para
gould meteorite which he found himself and
which is the largest meteorite ever seen to fall
and later recovered. It fell at 4 o’clock in the
morning of February 17, 1930, near Paragould,
Ark., and weighs, together with three other frag
ments broken off from it, 905 pounds.
3. A typical stony meteorite. This one almost
hit a man standing In his dooryard.
4. A typical Iron meteorite. This one fell near
Chihuahua, Mexico.
5. Hole in the earth made by the meteorite

6. Widanstatten figures—When an iron mete-
orite is polished and treated with acid, these
lines come Into sight. They are found only in
iron meteorites. •
over it These flakes may also be seen while the
surface is black. They are flakes of metal.
To see a meteorite actually crash to earth is
one of the most spectacular sights among nat
ural phenomena. One vivid description of a fall
some years ago tells us that the noise was like
“heavy cannonading, accompanied by an unearth
ly hissing,” and that the ground trembled as in
an earthquake. People rushed from their houses
in fright, and though it was midafternoon, they
saw a great “dazzling” ball of fire in the heav
ens, “like to the moon in size, sputtering and
throwing off a long train of sparks.” and leaving
in its wake “a heavy line of black smoke.” This
meteorite fell in more than a thousand frag
ments near Forest City, lowa. One piece, weigh
ing 66 pounds, fell near a farmer in a field and
buried Itself more than three feet in the hard
prairie soil.
Hardly a year passes without a fall somewhere
in the United States, witnessed by persons who
testify to its splendor and frightening aspect.
Fortunately, however, we have never been vis
ited by a meteorite such as fell on the isolated
steppes of north-central Siberia in 1908. The
force of the air, blasting out from it, mowed
flat more than seven hundred square miles of
dense forest. It killed a herd of 1.500 reindeer,
and forced a train, 400 miles south, to stop In
order to keep on the rails. A Russian farmer,
50 miles away, was knocked unconscious and re
turned to his senses to find the air so hot that
he feared his clothes would catch fire. His house
was demolished. *
This great mass of iron, buried deep in the
ground, is estimated to weigh 40,000 tons; but
it is small Indeed when compared to another
mass that fell on the desert plains near Win
slow, Arlz., in a time before the white men came
there. This enormous meteorite, which bored its
way more than 1,500 feet into the earth, is
known to weigh several million tons. It left
behind it a crater almost one mile across and
nearly 600 feet deep, as it appears today.
Many other tremendous falls have happened
since the world began. No doubt, if we were to
explore the bottoms of the oceans, we would
find hundreds of great masses of stone and iron
buried in the slime. Other great masses are
buried beneath our feet, and the craters which
they left behind them have been obliterated by
wind and rain. It has been discovered very re
cently, however, that traces of these craters may
sometimes be seen when viewed from aloft in an
airplane. Several groups of them have been
found In America during the past two years.
Where do meteorites come from? It is sup
posed that they are fragments of comets which
have been torn apart by the powerful gravita
tion of the sun and the larger planets of the
solar system. The Leonids are believed to be
fragments of Temple’s comet, which has disap
peared like the meteor showers. Another comet,
known as Biela’s, was actually seen to break up
and tonally to vanish entirely; but now we are
showered with an unusually large number of
meteors whenever it should be in the neighbor
hood of our earth, according to the computations
of astronomers.
How many meteorites have really hit the
earth? Professor Ninlnger estimates that more
than 87,000 of them have fallen on every square
mile of the earth’s surface since the mammoth
roamed the steaming forests of prehistoric times.
That means that the very ground on which we
walk is made up largely of the dust into which
they have fallen.
Confirmation of that belief Is seen in the the
ory advanced recently by Ralph W. Stone, as
sistant state geologist of Pennsylvania, that a
coating of meteorite dust 19 inches thick Iles on
I
the surface of the earth. This coating Is an
accumulation of 60,000,000 years or more, he
says, and is constantly being increased, although
at such a slow rate that it is not noticeable.
Out of 470 meteorite falls since meteorites be
came known and accredited, 125 years ago, 130,-
000 individual meteorites have been recovered,
or an average of 277 a fall. This figure supplies
one meteoric stone for each 400 square miles of
land surface of the globe In a century and a
quarter.
Most of the falls were observed in areas of
comparatively dense population and where sur
face conditions were favorable for observation
of the landing and for recovery.
“If we consider the 287 witnessed falls in Eu
ropean countries, Russia, India, Japan and the
United States, amounting to 129.349 individual
meteorites or 450 stones a fall, in a combined
area of 7,250,000 square miles, we have one me
teorite for every 55% miles,” Mr. Stone says.
“During the 125 years only two falls from
which stones were recovered were observed in
the w’hole western third of the United States,
apparently due to spare population and the
nature of the terrain. Although practically all
observed falls from which stones are recovered
occurred in daytime, there is no reason for as
suming that falls are not just as frequent at
night.
“On these assumptions, it is conservative to
estimate that in these twelve countries at least
ten times as many meteorites fell as were recov
ered, or one to each five and a half square
miles.”
If the rate of fall of the last century has
been constant, according to the assistant state
geologist, each square mile of surface has re
ceived 727 meteoric units. In the 60,000,000 years
since the beginning of tertiary times, on this
basis of computation, the earth received 87,240
meteorites a square mile.
“The weight of the 129,349 stones recovered,”
he continued, “was 17,074 pounds. This is a very
low average, since the larger stones usually bury
themselves, but this figure gives about two
ounces a stone.
“This would mean a five-ton-a-square-mile
average for the entire earth, in the last 125
years.
“Should we continue the computation for long
er periods we get into ponderable figures. Then,
if we figure not from the beginning of the ter
tiary time but from early Paleozic time, 600.-
000,000 rather than 60,000,000 years ago, we get a
weight of material which certainly would make
the earth wabble on its axis if concentrated in
one spot on the surface.”
Besides the meteorites which land, about a
million an hour daily are consumed in our at
mosphere before striking the earth, Mr. Stone
estimates.
“Considering five pounds the average weight
of these, that would mean 50,000 tons of mete
oric dust sifting down daily. Distributed over
the globe, however, the result would be a layer
one millimeter thick in 10,000 years, or a blanket
19 feet deep in 60,000,000 years.”

Look for Embalmihg Secret
The success of two Soviet scientists in main
taining Innin's dead body for a decade In a life
like state may lead to a universal revolution in
the science of embalming. •
These men, V. P. Vorobiev anu B. I. Zbarsky,
plan soon to share with the scientific world what
they have learned during a decade of experi
mentation in preserving bodily tissues. They are
working now on a long treatise.
To understand the emotional and political
meaning of Lenin’s preservation it is necessary
to revert to 1924, the year of his death. Having
led the Russian people through a bloody revolu
tion to a new social order, Lenin had become
more than a political chieftain. He was the sym
bol of the revolution, a prophet, the personifica
tion of an Ideal, the embodiment of the hopes
and aspirations of millions of workers and peas
ants.
Hence, when he died, his Communist comrades
well appreciated the emotional stimulus toward
Communism that millions who never had seen
Lenin in life would receive from looking on his
face.
They determined that nis body must be pre
served. Yet there was no precedent in science
for the long-term preservation of a body in its
original appearance.
• Under the direction of a commission of high
ranking Communists Vorobiev and Zbarsky began
their work. Their exact technique Is yet un
known. But they succeeded in embalming Lenin
so well that when, some time later, a group of
men who had worked with the dead leader for
years and knew him Intimately were called In to
view him they agreed that his exact expression
had been maintained.
So Lenin’s body was laid to rest in a glass
topped catafalque in a marble mausoleum
erected before the Kremlin. And in the interven
ing years It is estimated that more than 7,000,000
pilgrims have gazed upon the determined fea
tures and red beard of Communism'a most ardent
apostle."

SISTERSVILLE, W. Va., November
3.—What may turn out to be a fatal
accident occurred this morning on low
er Wells street, when one of the wagons
belonging to Moses Beaver accidental
ly ran over a young boy named Hilliard
who bas been visiting here for some
time. The accident occurred early in
the morning and was entirely unavoid
able on the part of the driver of the
wagon to whom no blame is attached.
As the wagon was coming along the
street with about two tons of steel
car axles, which were being hauled to
one of the tool §hops, when young Hil
liard started to coast down the hill in
a small wagon. Evidently his steer
ing apparatus got out of order, for
he and the wagon ran into the horses
and before the driver could stop the j
heavy wagon it had passed over the
boy.
The little fellow was picked up aDd
carried into a nearby house where he
was soon under the medical attention
of Drs. Kahle and Means. Everything
possible is being done to relieve the
,boy from the excruciating pain he has
been suffering. It is> believed that his
injuries are so serious that there are
grave doubts of bis recovering.

Rainbow: “Go to Charles Gosnell’s, then
to Crambblett’s,, then to Reynard’s, and
the ivoraen said the same thing.’’
Clayton Carter testified that Cram

mile from Charles Gosnell’s. Ha

heard the report of the gun. Rainbow
came for him and said: ""Somebody
shot Gosnell, shooting through the win

as Quincy and Gosnell had a racket.”
Rainbow's little boy was on behind him,
and he rode a. roan horse and the tracks
next day
Showed Only One Shod Foot.
Rainbow wore broad-toed gum-felt
boots. Jell Said his mother heard
some one riding up the run after the
shooting.
Stenographer <3. A, Campbell was put
on with his preliminary hearing notes
to tell of Elva Gosnell hearing her
father invite Quincy hack again and
to stay all night, from which her tes
timony this time -diverged. Her testi
mony about the dog being loose or tied
up that night was gpne over also. The
testimony of Hugh Best was gone over
to prove in bus • examination at that
hearing he never used the word “mus
ket."" A wordy dispute arose here over
showing that Rainbow made contradic
tory statements, as Rainbow had not
been on the stand. They were gotten
in the record. The objection was sus
tained by trying to show what way
Rainbow said he went home from Dil
lonvale. There were objections galore
on both sides over asking about certain
statements which it is hard to show in
a newspaper.
Leroy Roberts, an employe of Long
Run mines, saw Rainbow on the creek
road one mile above Dillonvale before
6 o’clock on the evening of Gosnell’s
murder. Rainbow rode a roan horse.
He was going to Dillonvale to bear
General Gregg and Thomas Love de
liver speeches.
Oliver Reeder was going from Mt.
Pleasant station to Dillonvale on tho
evening of Gosnell’s murder, and he
inti, *iainjow naing toward Long Run.
Rainbow could not pass Briar Ridge
school house going that way. He is
a distant relative of Cramblert.
Annie B. Yoder, of Long Run, tes
tified that she saw Jeff Rainbow near
Long Run stauon at 6:30 o'clock on
the evening of the murder, going to
ward the postoffice.
Judge Hollingsworth
Substnined Objection
to her telling what Rainbow said to
her on the Monday evening after the
murder, saying, ""Let’s get at the sub
stance before we get at the shadow.”
The prosecutor tried to show bias
against the State because her son was
prosecuted, but it was ruled out.
Thomas Wilson, who lives on the
road from Long Run toward Gosnell’s,
saw Rainbow about 7 o’clock on the
evening of Gosnell's murder. He went
past the butcher shop at Long Run,
going to and from the postoffice. lie
was still on the stand when court
opened in the afternoon. Attorney
Lewis tried to mix up tho witness as
to ""fast” and “railroad” time. He de
nied drinking that day. An attempt
to show him that a female witness for
the defense was not decent, was ruled
OUt.
Annie Wiilson testified to living
above Long Run station. She saw Jeff
Rainbow in Long Run about 7 o’clock
on the evening of the murder. Annie
Green said as he passed: “Jeff, you
seem to be in a hurry.” Jeff said:
“Yes, I have got business that I want
to attend to.” The witness denied
drinking that day. She dended know
ing that one of the witnesses for the
defense had danced the “houchee
kouchee” since coming to town.
Annie Green testified to living at
Long Run. She saw Jeff Rainbow the
evening of the murder. She said: “You
are in a hurry, Mr. Rainbow.” He
said: “I am,” and it sounded as of he
said he had some business to attend
to. She has been stopping
At the Dewt}1 Hotel.
She has been working several months
at East Liverpool.
Clara Green, of Long Run, saw Jeff
Rainbow on the evening of the murder
when he rode past her and she spoke.
Micajah Moore testified to meeting
Rainbow near Long Run on the Satur
day afternoon of the murder after 3
o’clock, and of seeing Rainbow on his
horse, which was standing still, read
ing what was on a billhead. Rainbow
folded it up and put it in his pocket
and rode toward Uiilonvale. The at
tempt was being made to show it was
a bill from the township trustees for
the building of the line fence which
Rainbow’laid at Gosnell’s doof.
Clayton Carter said it was two
miles from Gcsnell’s to Long Run. He
was asked about the distance from
Long Run to Briar Ridge school house
near Dillonvale, which Rainbow said
he passed on his way home the night
of the murder. He gave a comprehen
sive description of roads, creeks, etc.,
in that section.
The State produced the original bill
and recalled Micajah Moore to see if
he could identify it as the one Rain
bow was reading. The postmark show
ed November 29th, which was after
the murder, so it could not have been
the one.
Stenographer Campbell was called
to show
What Rainbow Testified
to at the preliminary hearing. The
State had Rainbow brought in and ex
hibited in order to get the fact of his
presence in the record. Everybody
took a good look at the much talked of
man. Rainbow’s testimony was not ad
mitted, but was gotten in the record.
Chas. Gosnell, son of the murdered
man, told of building the Rainbow line
fence under contract from the trustees
of Smithfieid township. He completed
building it in October, the month before
his father's murder. While he was
building it Rainbow was around twice.
A stop occurred here, due to a quiet
talk over admission of Rainbow's dec
larations.
’ TWEEN YOU AND ME.
DO YOT PI SII VOI R SISTER'S PACE.
(Popular Song.)
An old man tottered down the street,
With age his form was bent;
His voice was weak and almost gone,
Upon a cane he leant,
lie saw a curley headed boy ~
With his sister dear at play;
He saw him raise his hand in rage,
Then unto him he did say:
CHORUS.
""Do not push your sister’s face,
Do not smash her jaw.
It is not gentlemanly, and
It Is against the, law.
So do not raise your angry hand
And give her face a swat;
My boy. remember that it is
The only face she's got.”
The years rolled ylfl as years will do—
The boy grew to a man;
But there was nothing strange in this,
As it is Nature’s plan.
But often he w’ould think upon
The old man far away.
Who met him on the little street
And unto him did say:
CHORUS.
“Do not push your sister's face,
•J)o not >)lack here eye;
Do not spoil her countenance.
You'll rue It when you die.
So do not raise your angry mitt
And give her cheek a swat;
My boy, remember that It Is
Thfc only lace she's got.”

SHOOTING STABS.
Harvard's Fanou Cabinet of Meteor
orites—H*n a Meteorite May be
Worth Its Weight in Void—Compar
ative Value* and What They De
pend On—Carious Analogies With
Terestrial Bocks.
Special to the Register.
BOSTON, November 1.—If anyone is
so lucky as to find^gne of the “shoot
ing stars” which will fall in the me
teoric shows due the 13th and 14th of
this month, he may congratulate him
self on having captured a prize worth
its weight in gold. The number of col
lectors of meteorites is increasing, and
the competition between the different
cabinets, public and private, has caused
a great advance in the price of rare
specimens. J
The largest and finest collection of
meteorites on this side of the Atlantic
is the one in the Harvard Mineralogo
gical Museum in Cambridge. Reckon
ing European collections it ranks about
fifth or sixth in the world. The British
Museum has the best collection, as it
has of so many other things, and the
cabinets in Vienna and Paris rank
next. »ne principal part of the Har
vard collection was brought together
by one of the most distinguished of
American chemists, the late J. Law
rence Smith, of L.ouisville, Ky., whose
specimens were purchased by subscrip
tion in 1883, Professor Smith himself
being one of the subscribers.
<jaiuianng me comparative value or
collections of meteorites is something
of an art, however. A main point is
the number of “falls,” so called .which
are represented. Ordinarily, perhaps,
each meteoric mass which is found re
presents a separate fall; but often a
meteorie splits into several pieces, fall
ing 50 or 100 miles distant from one
another, on striking the earth's atmos
phere. The common origin of such
pieces is often demonstrated by an
alysis or by general appearance, but
more often, perhaps, it remains in
doubt.
About 275 falls are represented at
Harvard, with a total weight—another
factor in estimating comparative value
—of about 2800 pounds. The larges*
meteorite known is the famous one
discovered by Peary in Greenland. The
largest meteorite in the- Cambridge
collection weighs 1100 pounds. But the
largest meteor is not necessarily
the most valuable. Much de
pends on the matter of “con
trol.” A very large and famous
meteorite is Canon Diablo, so called,
in accordance w’ith the recognized rule
for naming meteorites, from the local
ity in Arizona where it was found.
Here great pieces of a thousand pounds
or more can be obtained by any one
who wants them for the trouble and
expense of carting them away. In
other words, no one “controls” it, and
it has little or no money value. On
the other hand, a much smaller and
less interes-mg meteorite owned wholly
or mainly by a single sabinet is likely
to be worth hundreds of dollars. A
single small piece of some notable me
teorite thus held may easily bring, for
example, at the rate of $75 to $100 a
pound. The pound indeed is much
too clumsy a standard for so valuable
a material as meteoric stone or iron,
and the weight of all specimens is re
carded in the catalogues in grams.
A museum needs only to keep the
bulk piece of a meteorite to retain con
trol of it. Other pieces it exchanges
with other collectors with a view to
increasing its representation of falls.
It is interesting to note how carefully
the weight and distribution of these
various pieces are set down in museum
records. One of the most celebrated
meteorites in the Harvard Museum is
Cynthiania, found in the township of
that name in Harrison county, Ky. It
weighed, when found, about 6000
grams, of which 4772 grams are “pro
vable”—that is, can be assigned to
different collections in various weights.
Of this amount, the two largest pieces,
weighing 3113 and 539 grams respec
tively, are retained by the University,
while other pieces, from a single gram
to upwards cf 400, are held for ex
change. When control is thus retain
ed, the museum is able to count the
meteorite as one of its “specialties.”
Harvard reckons on 23 such specialties
in'its collection,—controls, that is, the
largest and most representative pieces
of 23 separate meteorites.
In ancient times and among savage
tribes meteorites have always been
looked upon with more or less awe, and
have often been objects of worships.
The Palladium which fell at Troy, for
example, was doubtless a meteorite.
In three small meteorites discovered by
the Peabody Museum on altars raised
by the mound builders of the Little
Miami Valley in Ohio. Harvard posses
ses the only authentic prehistoric ex
amples known to exist. Such archaeo
logical or historical interest naturally
adds much to the market value of a
meteorite. A well known American
’Collector recently secured from the
Shah of Persia a number of pieces from
a famous semi-sacred meteorite which
had been in the possession of the royal
family for generations, and by dispos
ing of bits to various European mu
seums on his way home, was able, he
said, to pay all the expenses of his
trip to Teheran.
the Harvard collection is catalogued
according to date of supposed fall, al
though it is admitted that these dates
are often very uncertain. As the author
of the catalogue says,""theconnection be
tween me nre-ball which attracted at
tention and the meteoritte subsequent
ly found is often only assumed, and not
established.” A meteorite, however, is
more valuable if seen to fall. Next to
the pre-historlc Ohio specimens, the
earliest falls represented at Cambridge
are three dating back to 1164, two in
Saxony and one in Bohemia. One each
is ascribed to the fourteenth, fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries, and IS to the
eighteenth. The earliest American fall
recorded is Campo del Cielo, from the
Argentine Republic, 17S3; and the first j
in the United States, is the Weston, i
Connecticut, 1807.
Not every specimen offered to the
collector of meteorites is genuine; in- j
| deed, mistakes are common. Not long
ago an old farmer wrote to the Harvard
Museum stating that when he as a boy,
in 1840, he had seen a shooting star
fall in the field back of his house; this \
he had now dug up, and he was ready i
to receive an offer for it from the I
Museum. Cn examination the supposed I
meteorite proved to be a common ■
boulder, which had lain in the old I
man’s field for 20,000 years, more or j
| less. It is oftentimes a very difficult
| thing to locate the exact spot where j
a meteorite falls. The blinding light, j
the whole startling nature of the phe
nomenon, will often cause an observer
to think that it has fallen close at hand
when in reality the distance may be as
much as 23 or even 50 miles.
Overworked Women.
Fatigue is the natural result of hard work, but ex*
| haustion results from weakness.
Hard work for a weak woman is traffic in flesh and
I blood.
It makes little difference what the field of work is,
| whether at home or elsewhere, if there is weakness, work
I brings exhaustion.
Ability to stand the strain of hard work is the privi
j lege of the healthy and robust.
I How our hearts ache for the sickly women that work
for daily bread at some ill-paid factory employment 1
How distressing also to see a woman struggling with
her daily round of household duties, when her back and
head are aching, and every new movement brings out a
I new pain!
If the mere looking on at these suffering women
touches our hearts, how hopeless must life be to the wo
men themselves ?
Their devotion to duty is a heroism which a well
person cannot understand.
Can these ailing, weak women, who are called upon
to do work which would tire a strong man, be made to see
that they can easily and surely better their condition ?
Will not the volumes of letters from women made
strong by L^dia E. Pmkliam’s Vegetable Compound,
convince them of the virtues of this medicino ?
How shall the FACT that it WILL HELP THEM be
made plain ? S
Wheh a medicine has been successful in more than a
million cases, is it justice to yourself to say, without trying
it, “I do not believe it would help me”?
Surely you cannot wish to remain weak and sick and
discouraged, exhausted with each day’s work. You have
some derangement of the feminine organism, and Lydia
E. Pink ham’s Vegetable Compound will help you just
as surely as it has others.
Bead the letters from women in the opposite column
of this paper, and when you go to your drug store to buy
this sterling medicine, do not let yourself be persuaded to
accept the dn«ggist’s own valueless preparation because it
is a few cents cheaper than

Meteorites are either of stohe. or of
iron mixed with nickel. Before the lat
ter are put on exhibition they are us
ually cut in two to show a polished
surface, which is etched with acid to
bring out the yariety of the structure.
Certain meteorites thus treated show
what are called Widmanstaettian fig
ures a form of crystallisation of great
beauty which is found in terrestrial
iron, and then imperfectly, only in
specimens from Disco Islands, Green- \
land, where a mass of basalt has flowed ]
up from the interior of the earth.
Meteorites, of course, are the only
physical evidences we have of the com
position of other celestial bodies titan ;
our own. Their general scientific in- j
terest is that they probably represent :
the composition of the interior of our
earth. Although the Greenland iron U j
the only terrestrial iron resembling true j
meteorite iron, the cruft of the earth '
contains rocks very similar to both the j
stone and the iron meteorites, with the i
exception that the meteoric iron is
represented by some form of oxidisa
tion of iron. The oxidization has taken
place, of course, in the passage of these
rocks upward through the earth's
crust Another analogy is drawn from
the connection between iron sod tHa- j
Bonds. In South Africa diamonds ap
pear In a rock much Hke an iron me
teorite. with the distinction at oxidi
zation; and the first successful produc
tion of artificial diamond* was from iM
cooling of incited iron under pressure.
Add to these facts one more,—-that the

to contain micros^oiric diamonds,V~an4 .

Tlioiihands of meteorites enter 'he
atmosphere of the earth every day,
hut most of tie-in burn up before
they reach the ground. Many me
teorites have ben known to fall to
the ground weighing several tons.
The larg'-st meteorite known to have
fallen fell at Coon Butte, Arizona.
This meteorite was composed mostly
offroeteroic iron, and had a diameter
of between three and four hundred
feet."" This meteorite made a crater
between two and three hundred feet
deep and having a diameter of more
than half a mile. Piece of this
meteorite ""were fourwl scattered
about the crater to a distance of
five miles. Tho crater made by this
meteorita is below the general level
ofth surrounding plain, and it is
sUrrounacit by a ridge of rocks that
were pushed 'to one side and thrust
up to height of two or three hun
dred feet.'This crater, and the ridge
tflat surrounds it, exactly resembles
the craters of the. moon, and the
ridges and mountains that surround
them.
Those who have made a study of
this subject estimate that this me
teorite fell not lonsrer ago than two
thousand years. This meteorite is
thought to have had a velocity of
about five miles per second when
it struck the earth. The impact of
this meteorite generated heat enough
so that there was some fusion of
the sandstorm rocks. If this meteor
ite had had a velocity of twenty
miles or more per second, as many
have, it would have generated heat
enough to have caused a small vol
cano. Once in many thousand of
years much greater meteorites than
this fall, and sometimes several fall
at the same time, because they some
times come in streams. Because of
the greater gravitational intensity
of the earth, meteorites that fall to
it have a higher velocity than those
that fall upon the moon; and the
weight of the rocks, being so much
greater upon the"" earth cause the
meteorite to meet with far greater
resistance than they rrieet with upon
the moon when having the same ve
locity. All of this causes meteorites
to generate far greater heat when
falling upon the earth than when
falling upon the moon.
Since I read my first book on
astronomy, when a boy, I have held
that the craters of the moon are the
pit holes of fallen meteorite, but
Prof. G. K. Gilbert was the :'rl to
publish such a theory in 1Sii. This
theory of Trofessor Gilbert's is
known as the TColide or Impaet
theory. Among professional astron
omers thre are now many who be
lieve In this theory; but there are
many -who still hold to the old vol
canic theory. When men are edu
cated to believe in a certain way
they will sometimes refuse to accept
a. new theory even when the evi
dence Is greatly in favor of it.
Tf the craters of the moon were
volcanic craters they would. In gen
eral, be on the tops of moun'ains,
because that, is the way they are
hrc upon the earth, and there Is
no good reason to suppose that the
taws governing volcanoes would be
different upon th moon than here.
If the craters of the moon were vol
canic craters they would be filled,
er nearly filled, with lava because
that is the way they are here upon
the tartJi. The craters of thu moon
are sem-times three miles cWp.
This would be impossible, if they
were voloanl"". i raters. Thrrc is not
r enough upon the moon to sup
port extensive volcanic action, and
! is c'-rtuin thnt. thie revr v,-is
more wat'-r th're than now. there
fore the velcinie theory Is refuted
bv this alon.
If we cori'hid"" trv the inters of
'he moon are ,.jf hoi' s ni'ide by
:allen meteorites, ?. t must conclude
also that gnat meteorites, as v.- -1 1 as
small ories, , in u t of ri'cssi'y oee.-i-innally

b'-en diseowred whjeh mav well
lead us to d'-vo!e a c!oer attention
;to the composition and structuru of
j meteorites. It has been shown, on
the one hand, that some meteorites
I contain substances precisely simitar
;to those which are brought from the
'earth's interior during volcanic out
'bursts; and, on the other hand,
there have been detected, among
some of the ejection of volcanoes,
I bodies which so nearly resembled
meteorites that they were long mis
, taken for them.""
Page ?7: ""In the case of the
I.apari Islands, the fissures along
.which the volcanic mountains have
been thrown up radiate from a com:
men center, and a similar arrange
ment can be traced in many volcanic
j regions, especially those in which a
'great central volcafflo has existed.""
Page ilO: ""These basaltic dykes
j occur in such prodigious numbers
around volcanic vents, that the
whole of the at ratified rocks in the
.immediate vicinity are broken up by
a complete network of them, cross
ing and interlacing in complicated
fusion. Farther away from the vent
similar dykes are found in smaller
numbers evidently radiating from
the same center, and sometimes ex
pending to a distance of a hundred
miles from it.""
! When a great, meteorite strikes
the earth, which probably does not
t happen oftener than once in one
hundred thousand years, it breaks
the rocks fine around the hole that
, it makes, and Assures in the earth
i radiate from the hole to a distance
'of hundreds of miles sometimes. The
! lava that flows into these fissures,
large and small, and hardens, ul
, canologists calls dykes. f
j Not all volcanoes mark the place
i where a great meteorite strue-k the
earth. The majority of volcanoes are
'what are called fissure volcanoes,
that is, they are formed on the great
fissures that radiate from the place
where the meteorite struck. The im-
pact of a great meteorite causes a
j great central volcano , and, as a
! result of the lava flowing from this
i great central volcano into tho radi
'ating fissures, many fissure volcanoes
:are formed, because the lava that
Hows into 1 lie fissures needs vents,
and where these vents are formed
j volcanic mountains are thrown up
Prom the abovo it is evident that
the fall of one great meteorite might
cause a volcaoic region of constder
able extent. Sometimes when a great
meteorite strikes the earth, the crust
' of the earth is cracked for hundreds
i of miles in opposite directions from
j where the meteorite struck, and as
ja result of fissure volcanoes being
! formed on these fissures a moun
tain chain is built up.
Scientific men are coming to
realize, more and more every day
that volcanoes are simply local af
fairs, and have nothing to do with a
generally molten state of the in
1 terior of the earth. Although it is
! admitted that the earth is very hot
inside, scientific, men are coming to
realize more and more, as they ptudy
;the subject, that the earth Is not
land never could have been a molten
, mass of matter.
This theory that volcanoes ore
j caused by great meteorites striking
I the earth is my own theory so far
las I know, and it. Is a new theory. I
jam fully persuaded that future re
j search will confirm this theory, be
' cause I am convinced that all of tho
j phenomena connected with vol
canoes cannot be explained by any
other theory.

GAY PARTIES FOR
FLORIDAGl)ESTS
Arriving and Departing Notables
Are Feted
Palm Beach, Fla., March 17 0?)
Society struck a comfortable late
season stride this week, attending
many gay parties for arriving and
departing notables, but otherwise
disporting itself in enjoyable rather
than feverish activity.
Mrs. Clarence Jones, who has
moved into her new Vita Serena
home for the remainder of her stay,
entertained Mrs. Vincent Astor and
her guests when they stopped here
en route from Havana north.
With Mrs. Astor aboard her priv
ate car were Mrs. J. S. Cosden, Lady
Diana Manners of ""The Miracle""
fame, and Captain Bertram Cruce-r,
Mrs. Jones gave an interesting din
ner at the Everglades cluh, and Mr.
and Mrs. Harrison Williams, with
whom Lady Diana and the captain
stayed while here, entertained sev
eral times for the party at La Quer
ida, the Ocean Bluff home of Hod
man Wanamaker II. The Williams
since have closed the home and
started north.
M'-anwhile the Princess of Thurn
and Taxis arrived at the Vineta for
the spring season, and Princess Le
bowicz with her parents, Mr. and
Mrs. C. Bai Lihme and Mrs. Clement
A. Griscom III, of New York, are
staying at the Everglades.
Fprlng seems to have borrowed
a deal of winter's charm so far as
notables aro concerned, since many
of them are arriving daily. Mr. and
Mrs. Andrew Carnegie II have come
from their Fernandina estate for a
fortnight here. On the departure of
Otto H. Kahn, for New York. Mr.
and Mrs. Ogden Mills Reld of Now
York and their children are arriving
to spend a month at his villa Oheka.
Mrs. William K. Pick, who recent
ly arrived at. White Hall with Miss
Phyllis Walsh of Philadelphia, has
been joined by Mr. Dick, their two
sons and young John Jacob Astor.
Those seriously addicted to tour
nament sports for recreation have
gone elsewhere In Florida this week
for thrills. Women's golf at St.
Augustine and Bellealr drew enthu
siastic galleries, while men's golf at
St. Augustine and men's tennis at
Jacksonville commanded a share of
attention from the winter colonies.
Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Richards
were host recently at a gay dinner
at La Colmena, the Barton avenue
home of Jules Bache's father. The
guests went to the Oasis club later
for the dance and match hunt given
by Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Urban.

A largely attended benefit concert
for the Animal Rescue league, the

zation to provide) for cats and dogs
deserted by cottagers as the season

Prominent society women were pa-j

The attendant phenomena wit- <

of the fire ball; occasionally lumin- i

to that of thunder, and to many
it was the first warning that an un-j

that of a heavy explosion, distinctly I
heard by several people on the street.
In the country, four miles east of i
cordele, two terrific explosions were
noted louder than thunder, which bo
terrified the farm hands that they
ran frightened to their homes. In
the immediate vicinity of Pitts the
sound was described as several loud
explosions causing the earth to tremble,
followed in quick succession by
a number of lesser explosions.
The roaring and whizzing noise and

;o the booming of cannon and also the I
esser sounds are supposed to be due
o the explosion of the meteorite and,1

powerful dissuptive force upon it, I

immediately by the impact of

Fell Near a House.
The largest pieces, weighing 57
cunces, fell within less than 75 feet
}f Nancy Brinson's house, where it
was dug up a few minutes later still
warm, but not red hot as first reported.
The fragments entered the
Treshly plowed sandy soil to a depth
of about 16 inches, forming an in:onspicuous
hole less than 18 inches
In diameter and scarcely half so deep.
The fragment is irregular, rhomdotial
in shape. More than two thirds of
the surface shows the natural pitted
characteristics of an iron metoerite

which in places are to be seen patches
of silvery white nickel iron. The
remaining parts of the surface are
rough and angular with more or less
sharp projecting points showing evidence
of rupture from other fragments.
This surface is more or less
smoked, but it has not the thick
coating of the other surface. This
fragment is made up largely of nickel-iron
throughout which, in irregular
masses, occurs the stony material.
The latter consists mainly of gray
mineral interspersed with occasional
greenish granules.
A second fragment fell by the road-,
side within a hundred feet of Jim I
Harden's house, which is 700 feet
southeast of the Brinson house, and
within three feet of a negro boy who

No ""Foreign"" Elements.
It might be interesting to the reader
to know that up to the present no
elements have been found in meteorites
that have not been found on the
earth. This would seem to indicate
that likely all celestial bodios are

of meteorites was not accredited by
scientists, although numerous instances
were recorded. Plutarch tells of

The most generally accepted theory
is the meteorites are dispersed matter

although more study is needed
before a satisfactory decision as to
their origin can be reached.

SNOWSTKOM IN AN 1
AIRPLANE ENGINE. c
\
Unquestionably a snowstorm may 1
cause an airplane to crash. But the 1
news that a flying machine may come 6
to grief from a snowstorm of which ?
It is itself the cause seems startling. ^
Recent experiments at the United
States Bureau of Standards have ^
proved that such a thing may easily
happen. The kind of snowstorm referred
to. however, is one that
takes place inside the engine.
To form snow there must be moisture
and low temperature, both by
vaporation of fuel in the inlet system.
A decrease in temperature lessens
the quantity of water vapor that a
given volume of air is able to hold,
and the surplus condenses. Hence
the temperature drop produced by
vaporization of the fuel may produce
a condor sat ion of moisture and
turn it into snow.
This was definitely proved by laboratory
experiments with airplane
AnirinAo 41?
?n ??. ?uc luiuiHiiun or snow made
quick trouble. But a ready cure was *
to supply sufficient external heating ?
to orevent the temperature drop. 1
The chief danger from a snow- *
storm in the engine is not that It
causes a decrease in power, but ft,s
produces violent fluctuations of(l
power which can neither he predicted *
nor controlled by the pilot. These J?
fluctuations come when fragments 1
of the snow are dislodged, and result
in changes of speed similar to those (
produced by suddenly opening the,
throttle.
If such trouble brings disaster to
the plane, the snow will all melt before
the engine can be taken apart
for examination- There is then left,
nothing to substitute the pilot's'
report of engine trouble. It is be-1
lieved that this newly acquired Information
will explain many disasters
for which pilots have been unjustly
blamed.

The average American city sends

Easy.
The poulation of Keokuk, is 16,900
if one figures population on the
figures given out by statisticians thai
eighteen percent of the total popu'a
tion of a city casts its vote.
Taking this as a bas.s, it is easy
enough to figure out the population
figures. There were 3,045 votes caet
in Keokuk's city el'ection on Monday,
according to the official returns froin
City Clerk Sandberg. If this au-nb«r
is eighteen percent, 169 an-.l

When Keokuk's census iigure.3 were
announced as ©ply 14,423, people who
consider themselves in position to
know said that the population is
16,000. Statistics compiled by ex
perts on election figures show that
as a rule eighteen percent of a city's
population casts its vote. So it's
just a matter of arithmetic as to
figuring population.
Speaking of population if you were
among those who failed to be count
ed in the census taken in January,
the Keokuk Industrial association
would be glad to get your name.
Blanks can be given you then, which
will be filled out and sworn to, show
ing that you were missed and these
can be sent to Washington to be
added to the lists already made out
for Keokuk. The association would
like to have the names at once of
people who failed to be counted in
the census taking.
SCIENTISTS TO
HUNT METEOR
Men of Authority Planning to Hunt
For Meteorite 'Near Garfield,
Utah, Where It Is Supposed
to Have Fallen.
The proposed expedition of John
Patton, inventor and engineer, and
Prof. Francis C. Nicholas, curator of
the Maryland Academy of Sciences,
to search for the great meteorite
which is supposed to have fallen six
or seven years ago near Garfield,
Utah, is a matter of interest to sci
entists, says the New York Evening
Sun.
The belief in the existence of a
great meteorite in this neighborhood
is based upon observations of its
course at the time of its fall, upon
the surface indications in the vicinity
and upon finding pulverized rock
along the tunnels already made for a
depth of 150 feet in the search for
the great rock, which is estimated by
Mr. Patton to weigh 5,000 tons.
This search has both a commercial
and a scientific purpose. It is pro
posed to utilize the metal of which
the meteorite is undoubtedly com
posed. In this respect the attempt of
Mr. Patton and Prof. Nicholas re
sembles that of D. M. Barringer, of
Philadelphia, to discover the great
meteorite, known as the Canyon
Diablo meteorite, which made the
remarkable depression called by sci
entists meteorite crater in central
Arizona.
A great number of fragments,
varying in size from that of a pebble
the""size of one's finger tip to masses
weighing half a ton. have been found,
but the gigantic author of the crater
is as yet undiscovered.
A number of these specimens of
the Canyon Diablo meteorite, the
largest weighing Jl,100 pounds, are
on exhibition at the museum of
natural history.
These samples are of solid nicsel
iron—10 per cent nickel, 90 per cent
iron. It' is supposed that the Utah
meteorite, which the Baltimore expe
dition seeks, is composed of these
same substances in the same or
slightly different proportions.
ENGLAND WILL
HAVE HIGHWAYS
A New System of Speed Limits Will
Be Installed on Some of the Eng
lish Streets to Hurry
Transportation Along.
A new system of highways is to
be added to England's existing net
work of good roads. These are to
be for the use of express traffic
exclusively. No horse vehicles will
be allowed, according to the London
correspondence of the Kansas City
Star.
When you turn in on one of these
track roads you will pass a speed
limit sign of the usual kind, perhaps
""speed limit twenty miles an hour,""
but this won't mean what it seems
to mean. It will mean that no vehicles
with a maximum speed below that
fieure are allowed on the road. The
rule of the road wdll be to keep going
or to get on to the byways and lanes
reserved for crawlers. On this road
will be all the pleasure speeders,
making their sixty miles an hour
without thought of chickens, dogs or
children but more important than
these private and public passenger
cars will be the road trains drawn
by a ""new type of heavy truck that
will race the freight trains otv all
except long distance hauls.

one of the plans for speeding up ol-.l
England which are already well under
way at the ministry of transportation
under the energetic direction of Sir
Eric Geddes. All the existing roads
in England are being classified in
preparation for their assignment to
special grades of traffic. Some
them—'for example, the great North
road and other highways laid down
durins the Roman occupation ox
Britain—may be direct enough for
conversion to high speed traffic ail
the main highways are solidly enough
built and most of the byways, too, so
far as the road surface is concerned.
But most of the smaller roads wander
around tho countryside as if they had
been originally surveyed by a party
of children out picking flowers, and
many of the main roads have curves
that would be death to any fast
traffic.
Again, a peculiarity of roads almost
anywhere is that they liavo a way of
passing through towns. The roads
the ministry is planning now are to
be tborugh routes across the country
in every direction, passing close by
every large center of population, but
not entering any. This is an impor
tant matter in England, where towns
impede fast motor service more than
anything else. Even the London
busses that run on routes sometimes
forty miles out of London are ham

By ELMO SCOTT WATSON
ILL the autumn of 1934 see the earth
bombarded with a shower of meteors
or ""falling stars,"" a spectacular dis
play of ""Nature's fireworks"" which
will put to shame the most ambi
tious pyrotechnlcal effort that the
mind of man could possibly devise?
Astronomers believe there Is a chance
that It will. For, according to their
calculations, such a display Is at least
a year overdue. Here Is the reason:
On the nights of November 12 and
13, 1833, the world was visited with the greatest
shower of meteors of which there Is any certain
record. All along the eastern seaboard of the
United States people looked up at n sky that
was literally aflame with ""falling stars,"" many
of them as brilliant as the most brilliant ""fixed
star"" In the firmament. ""The stars fell on this
occasion like flakes of snow'
n
one observer has
recorded, ""and It was calculated that at least
240,000 of them had fallen during a period of
nine hours.""
Then people began to recall that exactly
the same date In 1709—§4 years earlier—there
had been a similar shower of ""falling stars.""
Again In 18f>0 there was a great shower and In
1867, one only slightly less spectacular than the
preceding year. Perhaps It was only coincidence
that these showers had come at S3 or 34 year
Intervals or perhaps It was another manifesta
tion of the regularity of Nature, At any rate,
the astronomers looked for another shower 1
1809, but it failed to materialize. Neither did It
come the next year. Evidently the S3 or 34-year
period had been skipped entirely.
Still undaunted by the failure of the Leonids
(for that Is the scientific name of these ""fall
ing stars"") to appear on schedule time In 1899,
the astronomers eyed the heavens hopefully
November 12 and 13, 1032. But once more they
were disappointed, as they were again last year.
But some of them still think that this coming
November may see the display of ""Nature's fire
works"" similar to those of the years mentioned
above. What has happened to these showers of
meteors at periods of one-third of a century?
Nobody knows. The disappearance of the Leonids
is one of the mysteries of science.
Meteors, except as they come In showers like
the Leonids, are not at all uncommon.

not step outside your hoiise-^and see several of
them In the course of lu t

There
can
minutes. The most of
them, of course, are very small—mere little wisps
of light that shoot across the heavens. But now
and then you may see a much brighter one. At
times, though not many of us will have the luck
to see It, one comes with a thunderous noise
like the roar of a cannonade, and a brilliance
that blinds the eyes.
What are these fiery travelers through our
heavens? Men used to think that they were actu
ally stars broken loose from their moorings.
Probably there are still many men who hold to
some such belief, but It Is very far from true.
The stars are great suns, many of them vastly
larger than our own sun, and millions upon mil
lions of miles distant from our solar system.
Meteors are the fiery display of stones, captured
out of space by the gravitation of the earth,
and heated to Incandescence by the friction of
the air that blankets our globe. These stones
pierce our atmosphere at almost unthinkable
speeds, ranging from 28,000 to 160.000 miles per
hour.
What becomes of them? They do not pelt the
ground around us? No, the most of them are
burned to ashes while still many miles above
us. Every now and then, however, one that Is
too large to burn up before it hits the ground
does come. Such stones are called meteorites,
and many thousands of them, weighing from
several ounces to several tons, are on exhibit In
our museums.
Anyone — especially farmers
may happen
upon a meteorlte. Prof. Harvey H. Nlninger of
the Colorado Museum of Natural History In Den
ver. who Is the world's greatest authority on
the subject, says that there Is probably not an
area ten miles square anywhere In the United
States, where at least one stone from the sky
is not waiting to be found. It may be under the
ground, especially if It Is a large one. or it may
be out In plain sight.
His conjecture Is based on wide experience,
for he has himself collected more than 1,500 of
them during the past ten years. His specimens
may be seen In almost every large museum in
the world : In London, Paris, Berlin. Vienna ; In
the Field museum In Chicago, In the Smithsonian
Institution In Washington, In the Museum of Nat
ural History In New York City; and In many
others. No other man has collected even one
tenth as many as he has. The most of Professor
Nlnlnger's stones have been bought from farmers
who turned them up while plowing, or who found
them In tramps across fields and pastures.
They are easy to recognize, when one knows
what to look for. Most meteorites are one of
two kinds: Iron meteorites or stony meteorites.
The ""Irons"" are always black on the outside,
when newly fallen; but when one has lain ex
posed to the air for a time, It will probably be
reddish-brown with rust. In either case, of
course, It will be very heavy. Often, but not
always, It will have peculiar pits In It, somewhat
like a piece of putty Into which somebody has
pushed his thumbs and fingers. Any strange
piece of iron, which Isn't clearly of some other
origin, may possibly be a meteorite.
Stony meteorites are a bit harder to Identify.
They, too, are always heavier than the average
•artb »tone ; and also they are always black on

the outside when newly fallen, turning to red
dish-brown In the course of time. Inside, how
ever, they differ greatly from Iron meteorites
and also from one another. One common kind
looks very much tike a piece of grayish-white
cement, covered with a coat of black paint; or,
if it Is an old fall, of black paint mixed with
rusty brown. Another kind Is quite black Inside.
Indeed, they may be almost any shade between
black and white under their outer crust
Stony meteorites are also often pitted, but the
pits are seldom as sharply defined as they are
In the iron variety. After the surface has turned
from black to reddish-brown, It often looks a
good deal like the crust of a loaf of cracked
wheat bread, with similar little flakes scattered
over It. These flakes may also be seen while the
surface Is black. They are flakes of metal.
To see a meteorite actually crash to earth Is
one of the most spectacular sights among nat
ural phenomena. One vivid description of a fall
some years ago tells us that the noise was like
""heavy cannonading, accompanied by an unearth
ly hissing,"" and that the ground trembled as In
an earthquake. People rushed from their houses
In fright, and though it wag midafternoon, they
saw a great ""dazzling"" ball of fire In the heav
ens. ""like to the moon In size, sputtering and
throwing off a long train of sparks."" and leaving
In Its wake ""a heavy line of black smoke."" This
meteorite fell In more than a thousand frag
ments near Forest City, Iowa. One piece, weigh
ing 06 pounds, fell near a farmer In a field and
burled Itself more than three feet In the hard
prairie soil.
Hardly a year passes without a fall somewhere
In the United States, witnessed by persons who
testify to Its splendor and frightening aspect.
Fortunately, however, we have never been vis
ited by a meteorite such as fell on the Isolated
steppes of north-central Siberia In 1908.

dense forest. It killed a herd of 1,500 reindeer,
and forced a train, 400 miles south, to stop In

50 miles away, was knocked unconscious and
turned to his senses to find the air so hot that
he feared his clothes would catch fire. His house

known to weigh several million tons,

nearly 600 feet deep, as It appears today.
Many other tremendous falls have happened
since the world began. No doubt. If we were to

they left behind them have been obliterated by
wind and rnln. It has been discovered
cently, however, that traces of these craters may
sometimes be seen when viewed from aloft In an
airplane. Several groups/Of them have been
found In America during the past two years.
Where do meteorites come from? It la
posed that they are fragments of comets which
have been torn apart by the powerful gravita
tion of the sun and the larger planets of the
solar system. The Leonids are believed to be
fragments of Temple's comet, which has disap
peared like the meteor showers. Another comet?
known as Bieln's, was actually seen to break
and finally to vanish entirely; but now we are
showered with an unusually large number of
meteors whenever It should be In the neighbor
hood of our earth, according to the computations
of astronomers.
How many meteorites have really hit the
earth? Professor Nlninger estimates that
than 87,000 of them have fallen on every square
mile of the earth's surface since the mammoth
roamed the »teaming forest» of prehistoric times.
That means that the very ground on which we
walk Is made up largely of the dust Into which
they have fallen.
Confirmation of that belief 1s seen In the the
ory advanced recently by Ralph W. Stone,
slstant state geologist of Pennsylvania, that
coating of meteorite dust 19 Inches thick lies
the surface of the earth. This coating Is an
accumulation of 60,000.000 years or more, he
says, and la constantly being Increased, although
at such a slow rate that It Is not noticeable.
Out of 470 meteorite falls since meteorites be
came known and accredited. 125 years ago. 130,
000 Individual meteorites have been recovered,
or an average of 277 a fall. This figure supplies
one meteoric stone for each 400 square miles of
land surface of the globe In a century and a
quarter.
Most of the falls were observed In areas of
comparatively dense population and where sur
face conditions were favorable for observation
of the landing and for recovery,
""If we consider the 287 witnessed falls In Eu
ropean countries, Russia, India, Japan and the
United States, amounting to 120,349 Individual
meteorites or 450 stones a fall, In a combined
area of 7,250,000 square miles, we have one me
teorite for every 55% miles,"" Mr, Slone says.

ten times as many meteorites fell as

Footprints left' on a muddy shore
by some of the first feet that ever
walked the earth recently were
brought to Mount Union college, Al

Lamb of the geology department.
The soft mud on which the long-gone
animal walked was burled and ages
ago hardened into stone. The five
foot slab recording their passage was
found on a farm In Ohio.
The animals were members of the
primitive amphibian family called
Stegocephalklae, which came ashore
and walked some two hundred mil
lion years ago.
There were 90 species of this fam
ily In the Coal ages, but the whole
stock vanished as long as 125,000,000
years ago, according to Science
Service. They all seem to have been
short-legged, elongated creatures
with armored skulls. The slab shows
that the animal which made these
tracks had four toes on each front

be finds it to b^ a crater rim composed
of loose fragments of materials of all
sizes, from inieroscropic' dust to blocks
welching hundreds of tons. Mounting
to the summit of the rim hi looks down
upon a scene which can best be described
in Dr. Merrill's own words:
*

""Ti e view from this point, particularly
about sundown or by moonlight, is weird
and impressive in the extreme. The inwardly
steep and even overhanging walls,
profoundly shattered, surrounding on
every side a broad, deep pit accessible
on'y by tlie steepest of trails, barren of all
but the scantiest* of vegetable life and
gashed by torrential action, present a picture
which, when one reflects on its probable
origin, is never to be forgotten.""
Old settlers have ever been satisfied in
their belief that tiiis eratei: was caused
by volcanic action. But the fact that 110
other volcanoes were near this region and
the further fact that its sedimentary
rocks have not been disturbed by any upheaval
caused geologists to indulge in no
little speculation as to the source. That
a great meteorite might have been the
cause was considered some thirteen years
ago. but abandoned for insufficient evidence.
But lately Daniel M. Barringer. a
wgll known mining engineer, and Benjamin
C. Tilgman. an expert on projectiles,
who had held to the belief that a giant
meteorite caused the great depression,
proceeded to sink shafts in and about the
crater with a view of locating the fallen :
body and of exploiting it as a source of <
meteoric nickel, iron and platinum. As a
result of their borings they became satis- :
fled that a great meteor produced the ]
crater and it was their report to this ef- j
feet that led Dr. Merril! to investigate.
The great hole measutes 11.030 feet 1
across, from east to west: 3,830 feet, from '
north to south, and the depth is now i
about W feet from crest to rim. It was :
considerably deeper at one time. The 1
crater rim rises to from 120 to 1 BO feet !
above the surrounding plain. The floor 1
of the crater is a nearly level plain of ?
over ."".00 acres. f

Dr. Merrill saw that ihe crater could *|
not have been formed by any volcanic ac- ,
tion, since ail evidence of the disturbance 1
was n*at the surface. The surrounding 1
plain consisted of some .100 feet of lime- *
stone, under which was about 300 feet of
sandstone. This had been so thoroughly c
shattered bv some powerful blow from '
above that quartz particles in the sand- 4
stone had been in part fused, into glass.
Since the high degree of temperature necessary
for this melting of quartz had not
disturbed the sandstone further beneath,m<

Dr. Merrill regards it as possible that the

Its iron fragments have been found scattered
far and wiile on the surrounding
plain. one large piece being discovered as
far as eight miles eastward and another
being long ago found twenty miles to the
southward. Ton after ton of this material
has been carried away by visitors or
purchased from an Indian trader in the
neighborhood, who hired men and boys to
plow the ground in search of it.
These fragments of the exploded projectile
have weighed anywhere from 1,013
pounds to less than a gram, that of the
maximum weight given being now in the
Field Columbian Museum, Chicago. The
National Museum. Washington, has two
weighing, respectively, [Km and 740
pounds. Some fragments have been found
to contain small colorless octahedral diamonds.
also ""yellow and black particles
having the hardness of diamonds.
The gr>-at projectile appears to have

from an angle perhaps not less than
seventy degrees. This Is indicated by tiie

those produced by heavy projectiles moving
at high velocity, according to Mr.
Tilghman. the projectile expert above
mentioned. All signs which might be expected
of the impact of a great projectile
he finds present. Dr. Merrill says that the
sand grains were crushed by a sudden
shock ""such as might possibly he imparted
by an explosion of dynamite.""
*
*
How big was the great meteorite? According
to Mr. Tilghman, a 500-foot projectile
would produce a crater of this
size in rocks as brittle as those of this
particular vicinity. Dr. Merrill suggests
that if a meteoric iron ball of this size
fell upon the spot at a speed of five ,
miles per second the Impact upon the
moist sol! would produce steam with an
enormous explosive power. As a result >.
quantities of debris, including even por- '
tions of the meteorite itself, would be <
thrown back above the, crater rim and i
scattered widely over the plain, as in j
this case. This explosive action seems to <
have occurred some little time after' the '
meteor came to rest. Possibly thus was !
thrown out such of the""meteor's . mass t
as was not converted Into vapor by the
Intense heat generated at the moment of i
dAS BECOME
Hi-? great meteor ma> yet be below the
crater floor, however, since the methods
uf boring are not sue!: as would reveal
them if present. It is possible, however,
that I he meteorite may have been considerably
smaller in diameter than .~>u? feet,
and that the outrush of vapor caused
by its enormous expansion in passing
from a solid to- a gaseous condition
would have served to tear away the rock
and increase the diameter of the resulting
crater.
No known meteorite can compare in
size with that which produced this crater.
according to Dr. Merrill. The next
largest known is the great ""Cape York ""
which Commander Perry brought from
Greenland and which weighs hi*'; tons.
Then come the ""Bacubirito,"" of tons,
and the ""Williamette,"" of 15.6 tons.
y -*
The deepest that any oilier meteorite
has been known to penetrate is eleven
l'cet. This was a six-hundred-and-sixtypound
stone that fell in Knyahinya, Hungary.
It produced an impact crater, illustrating
almost perfectly what is supposed
to have happened in Arizona.
Peary's great tliirly-seven-and-a-lialf-ton
iron fell on a bed of boulders and was
found only partially covered. But it is
not unlikely that the ground at the time
was thick with ice and snow that checked,
its speed. A few feet of light snow will
check lead bullets from a modern rifle
without abraising it. The twenty-ton
Baeubarito meteorite was found in soft
so I! and but little below the surface,
while the fifteen-and-a-half-ton Williant<Hte
meteorite was found scarcely buried
in a ptinieval forest. But these other
great meteorites might have arrived in a
lirection following earth in her course,
[vhi!e this vast Arizona meteorite might
tave come in the opposite direction and
:hus at a much more terrific velocity.
Thus a meteorite with a velocity of

And whence came this colossal projectile?
iJr. Merrill does not speculate upon
this point, and we must leave the question
to others. Laplace suggested that
meteorites were thrown to earth by the
volcanoes of the moon, but since those
volcanoes appear to be no longer a> tlv e
astronomers and geologists alike refuse
n.iw to entertain this old t ' ory.
Sir Robert Rail suggested that they

‘What The Heck
Is A 801ide....?’
You can’t make much money
from meteorites (you can't make
any money from meteors), but if
a meteorite falls through your
roof you should feel honored.
A meteorite is a meteor that
got through the envelope of at
mospheres around the earth and
reached Kansas, or Canada, or
the Carpathian Mountains, or the
sea. or anywhere. Most meteors
burn before they reach the earth.
Meteors are pieces of matter
from disintegrated planets. They
are not visible unless they reach
the earth’s atmosphere, where
they ionize the air around them,
giving off light. They are collo
quially called either shooting or
falling stars, depending on how
you view them.
When they become meteorites
by reaching the earth’s surface,
these pieces of matter may be no
bigger than a grain of sand or no
smaller than a tool shed.
The largest ever found fell in
South Africa. Because it weighs
37 tons, it is still there. A meteo
rite weighing 17 tons has been
brought back from the Arctic.
The largest ever known to fall in
this country never was found—it
created the. Barringer Crater in
Arizona, about MX) feet deep and
4.(XX) feet wide Digging and drill
ing have never uncovered the ac
tual Barringer meteorite, though
pieces of it have been found
scattered around the crater. The
Barringer Crater provided an
excuse for the founding nearby
of Crater Junction, about five
miles south of Route 66.
An even larger crater is Chubb
Crater Lake in northern Canada,
one of the largest symmetrically
rc'und potholes on earth—two
miles across and filled with wa
ter.
Meteors and meteorites occa
sionally take the form of fire
balls. one of which was seen over
North Carolina last year. Fire
balls are very bright, have tails
of flame and lend to make people
nervmr. particularly in this age
of missiles, counter-missiles, and
anti-counter-missiles. But a fire-
COLONIAL BUG CLEANFRS
Phone 942-2960
ball need not be any larger than
a baseball to do its job.
The appearance of meteors and
their variations is impossible to
predict. But the appearance of
comets and meteor streams is
predictable.
A comet is a mass of frozen
gasses traveling in an orbit. A
good example is Halley's Comet,
which goes past regularly, though
so infrequently that the average
person never can remember ex
actly when it is due.
A metor stream is like a river
qf gravel in space and also trav
els in an orbit, hence is predict
able. Around the turn of the cen
tury ‘'stars” fell on or passed
over Boston at an estimated rate
of 30.000 an hour. Astronomers
predicted the stream’s return
some years later and were right
—the stream came back, though
not at the rate of 30,000 per hour,
since pieces of the river of grav
el had fallen out along the way.
People who know the outdoors
can usually spot a meteorite on
the ground when they see one.
Meteorites have a different look,
feel and heft than most ordinary
stones. They are heavy for their
size, they are solid rather than
porous, they are irregularly
shaped 'none are round*, black
or brown on the outside, and may
reveal specks or patches of me
tallic iron when a small area of
their surface is ground on a car
borundum wheel.
Samples of meteorites are now
on display in the Morehead
Planetarium, on permanent loan
from the collection of John Al
den Farrell, a graduate student
in physics at Duke University.
Anybody who finds what seems
to be a meteorite may have it
identified by sending it to the
Planetarium for tests. The Plane,
tarium may even find a buyer
for a meteorite, though they are
not valuable—prices paid are
only to stimulate interest in and
search for them.
In addition, the Planetarium’s
current show is entitled “Me
teors, Fireballs, and Bolides,”
and is being presented through
November 27. going into some
detail about the hurried, aimless,
lonely lives of flying bits of mat

| A Huge Meteorite Re= |
I cently Discovered, |
PROF. HENRY A. WARD, of
Rochester, N. Y„ the veteran
meteorite hunter, recently
found a meteorite of tremen
dous size. It has a length of thirteen
feet and one inch; width, six feet and
two inches; thickness, five feet and
four inches, and weight fifty tons.
Professor Ward lias named it Bacubir
ito, after the mining town near which
it was unearthed, and which is situ
ated on the Rio Sinaloa, Mexico. It
took twenty-eight able-bodied peons
one entire day to uncover its upper
surface, making an excavation thirty
feet on a side, with the great meteorite
lying within. At the end of the second
day they were able to bring the huge
mass to a semi-vertical position, the
Mexicans standing aghast at the reve
lation of their work.
The Bacubirito was found on a farm
called Ranchito, which fills the narrow
mountain valley, running nearly north
and south, and 2000 feet above the
level of tile sea. It lay in a cornfield,
close by tlie eastern edge of the valley,
which is covered by a black vegetable
soil two yards in thickness. The giant
meteorite lay imbedded in the soil with
END VIEW OF THE METEOBtTE.
one end slightly projecting above the
level. Professor Ward walked for
many feet along and across its surface,
surveying the dimensions ns far as
they were exposed, but lie had no idea
how far the large and heavy mass pen
etrated the soil beneath until the work
of excavation was begun.
The characteristic pittings covering
the entire surface are well marked,
and very regular in size—about two
or three inches across, with well de
fined yet low walls. The bed in which
the tremendous rock lay was found
to be a clean depression crushed into
the rock with absolutely no trace of
soil between it and the part where the
full weight of the mass had fallen,
showing that the meteorite had fallen
on the bare surface of this district at
a period before the vegetable soil had
begun to form here, carrying back the
fall of Bacubirito to a remotely distant
perod.
For half a century Professor Ward
has been collecting and studying me
teorites. He has interested himself in
them in every part of the glohe where
they have been found. As the result
pf his personal exertions he has in
stalled at the American Museum of
Natural History, New York, the Ward
Coonley collection of meteorites, allow
ing this collection, which represents
an amount of labor, research, indefat
igable industry and painstaking inge
nuity of which the average visitor is
entirely ignorant, to lie placed in the
halls of this museum for inspection
and study. The collection represents
511 distinct “falls,” about five-sixths
of all the meteorites known to science.
To see these elsewhere would require
a visit to the great museums of the
world and many cabinets of private
collectors. Bacubirito, however, is
possessed of qualities which render
it of greater scientific value than any
of Professor Ward's other meteorites.
The inner structure shows the octahe
dral system of crystallization in a very
marked degree. No other meteoric iron
is known which shows this so well.
Fractured surfaces show crystalliza
tion plates with faces from three to
nineteen millimeters in greatest diame
ter. Many of these faces are covered
with fine films of tacnite, which in
most cases are of the characteristic
bronze yellow color. Acid brings out
the Widmanstattian figures in a most
beautiful manner. From the coarse
crystals on a fractured or weathered
face of this iron we might anticipate
that etching would reveal a large wide
pattern in its markings.
As a fact, cuiite the reverse is true.
The figures, while very sharp, are
small in pattern, and are composed of
narrow blades of kamaeite, but a frac
tion of a millimeter in thickness. At
intervals, these blades appear to be of
more than doublq, that thickness, but
when examined with a glass it is seen
that these apparently broader plates
are composed of what might be termed
“bundles” of narrow kamaeite bands.
Tile rhombic figures on the etched face
will average from one and a half to
five millimeters in diameter, two an
gles of same being sixty degrees and
120 degrees, while the triangular mark
ings will generally range from eight
to fifteen millimeters with angles of
fifty-five degrees and seventy degrees.
Two or three troilites are shown, and
the iron is essentially tough.
After a long, protracted effort. Pro
fessor Ward succeeded in detaching
from tlie mass an already partly loos
ened piece of about eleven pounds in
weight. This, polished and etched on
one side, showing the beautiful Wid
manstattian figures, has taken its place
in the Ward-Coonley collection of me
teorites. This collection is now on dis
play (on deposit) in the American Mu
seum of Natural History in New York
City.—Scientific American.
Creates a Demand.
It was once an aphorism that the
manufacturer must make what people
desire in order to effect sales. The
age of advertising has changed this.
By judicious and persistent newspaper
advertising manufacturers and dealers
have created a demand for new ar

years would have been required to es
tablish a market for their new crea

they did in earlier years. One of these
moose about two weeks ago came out
of the forest and took up its quarters
at a farm house near the village of
Newcomb. Newcomb is in the western

which is about two years old, seemed
to have had hard usage. One of its

A curious story comes to us from the
suburbs. A resident in the near neigh
borhood of London has a museum in
his house, in which the principal curi
osity is a fire god, which has been
worshiped for many centuries in an
Indian temple. Once, when the owner
of tile house took a party of people to
look at the museum, he proposed in
fun that they should all kow-tow to
the image. This they all laughingly
consented to do, all except two ladies,
who declared it was wicked. The fire
god was revenged within two months.
One of the ladies had her house burned
to the grouna the week after, and the
other one ton a later date) fell back

terrible burns. We give the tale with

suited to all the occasions of life.
Morning jackets render their wearers
attractive while providing perfect ease
are much to be desired because of
those two facts, in addition to which
their readiness often means slipping
off the better gown for a brief rest
and a consequent saving. This very
attractive May Manton model is shown

The Mission of the Skirt yoke.
The skirt yoke is having immense
popularity with girls and women in
clined to “embonpoint.” It gives a
fresh starting point for pleats, and
gathers or shirs, and keeps all redund
ant fulness away from the waist line.
Nevertheless, it can easily be overdone,
as is frequently the case when any
mode is adopted with enthusiasm.
Therefore, it is better to have one
street dress only made in this way, as
you will not have more than one gown
rendered ""old style” if it, or they, sur
vive this season. Some dressmakers
keep all tucks and pleats and paneling
below the knee, but this is only to be
recommended when a woman is un
commonly tall. To be slender and tall
is the desideratum nowadays, and all
the lines of dress are arranged to pro
duce and enhance this effect.
Woman’s Work Apron.
Every housewife, every artist ana
every other woman whose occupation
means danger of soil to her gowns,
feels the need of a protective apron.
This very excellent model was de
signed with direct reference to such
need and is eminently serviceable and
satisfactory at the same time that
it is tasteful. The original is made of
white lawn and is simply stitched, but
gingham and all apron materials are
appropriate and bands of embroidery
can be substituted for the plain ones
if desired.
The apron is made with fronts and
backs that are gathered at their upper

yoke, a shawl collar and elbow sleeves.
The fronts are lapped in double-breast
ed style and are held by invisible
fastenings. The sleeves are edged with
graduated circular frills that are grace-1

The quantity of material required
for the medium size is four and three
fourth yards twenty-seven inches wide,
three and one-fourtli yards thirty-two
inches wide or three and one-eighth
yards forty-four inches wide.
Woman’s Jacket.
Stylish snug-fitting jackets always
are fashionable and make ideal wraps
for general wear. The smart May
Manton model shown in the large
drawing is shown in kersey cloth, in
royal blue stitched in corticelli silk
and finished with collar and cuffs of
velvet edged with bands of white cloth,
but all cloaking and suit materials are
appropriate, as the design suits the
odd coat and the entire costume equal
ly well. When desired the fronts can
be rolled back to form revers as shown
in the small sketch.
Th jacket consists of fronts, side
fronts, umler-arm gores, back and side
backs. When plain seams are pre
ferred those at front and back are
simply closed on indicated lines, the
stitched tucks and underfacings, that
form the slot seams, being omitted.
The fronts are deeply faced and meet
the collar that is sewed to the neck

Senator Clark said he did not
know, but recalled that in the
1930 s when the Civilian Con
servation Corps organised the
armed forces were segregated.
• We have come a long way
since then,” Senator Clark
added.
Senator Goldwater had made
the point that although the old
civilian conservation law pro
hibited discrimination in en
rollment. the CCC camps were|
set up on a segregated basis.
Assurance Sought
Senator Javits, Republican
of New York, said he was not
worried about how the Fed
erally - operated conservation
camps would be operated under
Title 1 of the bill. But he said
he is worried about whether
discrimination will be avoided
under Title 2, which provides
for work projects sponsored by
States and cities, with the
Federal Government financing
I part of the cost.
The New Yorker said he
would not be for an amend
ment that would kill the bill,
but insisted that assurance be
given as to how the Federal:
money will be distributed under
Title 2. He said the Civil
Rights Commission has found
that discrimination occurs in
some other State programs re
ceiving Federal aid.
Earlier Senator Goldwater
icalled the administration bill
“a sham.” He said it would
'not equip young people with
skills they need for available
job opportunities.
Senate leaders have promised
Senators they can join the
House in a 10-day Easter re
cess starting tomorrow night
Ilf they pass both the youth
employment bill and the $15.1

Senator Toldwater cited the

Meteorite Age
Pre-Dinosaur
Government scientists estl-i
mate a meteorite that fell in
Africa last August began me
andering through space almost
a half billion years ago—long
before the age of the dinosaurs.
The 19-pound cosmic visitor'
struck the earth near Bogou,
Upper Volta, August 14.
The entire meteorite has
been under study in the United
States since late last fall.
Now, half of it—mounted in
a display case—will be re
turned permanently to the Re
public of Upper Volta. Presi
dent Maurice Yameogo of
Upper Volta has authorized di
vision of the other half among
American and French research
ers for scientific studies, the
AEC said, adding:
“The scientific facts on the
meteorite already assembled
. . . confirm that the intensity
of cosmic radiation was con
stant throughout its travels in
space.
“This indicates that the
meteor did not orbit near the>
earth for any extended period,
since the earth’s shadow would
have shielded it from cosmic
radiation.’’
The AEC said the radioac
tivity of the meteorite was
twice that of a fragment of a
Soviet Sputnik which fell at
Manitowoc, Wise., and “this
proves that the meteor had
been in deep space rather than!
in orbit near the earth as was
the Sputnik.”
The announcement said ""the
likely age of the meteorite is
440 million years—or three
times as old as the era in which
dinosaurs were most prevalent.”
lumbla to illustrate his point I
that many young people are
idle today because they do not
have the skills to accept avail-
1 able opportunities.
Cites Newspaper Ads
In the Nation's Capital, the
Senator said, the Sunday news
papers of March 24 carried a
total of 2,600 job-opportunity
ads at a time when there were
27,000 listed as unemployed in
the area.
The youth bill, a major
plank in the Kennedy program, j
is in two parts, as follows:
1. Federal conservation corps,
similar to- the one set up by
Franklin D. Roosevelt 30 years
ago. to put 15,000 young men
to work in parks and forests.
2. Federal aid to the States
to help them organize local
projects in which up to 60,000
boys and girls could be em
ployed performing community
services.
Prouty Move Defeated
For the first year the bill
authorizes S6O million for each
program, or a total of $l2O
million.
In the first vote on the bill,
(Senator Prouty, Republican of
Vermont, was defeated when
he tried to have it referred
to the Interior Committee on
grounds it is essentially a con
servation measure. The vote
was 58-29. The bill came from
the Labor and Welfare Com
j mittee.
I On another roll call late yes
terday the Senate adopted.
65-21, a motion by Senator
Proxmire, Democrat of Wis
consin, reducing the first-year
cost of the youth program by
S2O million. This brings it
down to the SIOO million re
quested by the administration
to be equally divided between
the two parts of the program. ;
The Republicans are almost
solidly against the bill, con
tending that more vocational
training in the high schools
would be a better solution.
Democratic leaders are confi
dent, however, that enough :
Democrats will stay in line to
pass the bill by a margin of
about five votes.

Wilderness Bill
Faces Doubtful
Fate in House
By the Aasoclated Preu
A bill aimed at preserving
millions of acres of public land
in their wild natural state has
again cleared the Senate—and
again faces an uncertain future
in the House,
The Senate yesterday passed.
73-12, the administration bill
to establish a wilderness system
for 7 million acres of Federal
land. It eventually would cover
35 to 40 million acres
A similar measure passed the
Senate by an even bigger mar
gin in 1961. But it died in the
House Interior Committee
(headed by Representative As
pinall. Democrat of Colorado.
He contends Congress should
set ground rules for the ad
ministration of public lands
before putting them into
wilderness areas. He has sched
uled no action of wilderness
legislation this year.
Strong Opposition
Several conservation groups
have indorsed the Senate
measure. It has drawn the fire
of ranches, prospectors, oilmen
and lumbermen who contend
their privilege of leasing Gov
ernment land might be weak
ened
Senator Dominick, Republi
can of Colorado, unsuccessfully
sought passage of a series of
amendments sponsored by Sen
ator Allott, Republican of Colo
rado.
The sharpest fight came on
Senator Dominick’s motion to
require Congress to specifically
approve each area to be added
to the wilderness system. It
was defeated, 49-35. As writ
ten, the bill authorizes Con
gress to veto any proposed in
clusion of Federal lands under
the system.
Senator Domtnlsk and other
opponents argued that the bill
would prevent development of
minerals and other resources
on millions of acres of public
land.
Church Leads Fight
Senator Church, Democrat of
Idaho, who led the fight for
passage, said existing develop
ment rights would be main
tained. He said the bill calls
for a periodic review of re
sources in lands to be added
to the system.
Opponents also said the bill
would take authority from Con
gress and give Congress only
veto power over addition of

After the meteorite sank into the
earth the sand and dust settled into
the depression. The drift of ages
sifted eiver the edges of the huge bowl
and assisted in the work of covering
the meteorite.
Hiit the most remarkable thing
about this meteorite, apart from its
prodigious size, is the fact that in all
probability is consists of one huge dia
mond. This is inferred from the fact
that numerous large fragments of the
meteorite found in the crater, and
which are unusually heavy, were
found, upon investigation, to contain,
besides meteoris iron, large, hard,
black diamonds of great value.
Even if the meteor itself consists
only of black diamonds its value would
be quite inconceivable, for a good
black diamond, though worthless as
a gem, is worth even more than a
white one for mechanical purposes. It
Is quite probable, however, that the
bulk of the meteor consists of white
diamond, in which event there would
not be enough wealth in the world to
pay for it at the current price of the
precious stone.
Tts Value Inconceivable.
The largest diamonds in the world,
including the* Koh-i-noor, the Culli
nan, the (treat Mogul of Russia, the
Orloff, the Great Premier diamond,
the Tiffany diamond, the Etolle Po
lalre, and a dozen others of the same
standard, worth In the aggregate hun
dreds of millions of dollars, might all
be placed together in an ordinary der
by hat and not reach the top. This
meteoric diamond, scientists believe,
must be at Jeast half a mile thick! The
significance of this comparison is ap
parent.
It has long been supposed that all
diamonds might be of meteoric origin,
the scientists being unable to agree
whether the bottomless bores in which
they are found and which are known
as ""diamond pipes,"" are the result of
ancient volcanic action—explosions of
subterranean laboratories which are
nature's diamond factories, or of me
teors, which are themselves the cruci
bles from celestial regions in which
diamonds are produced.
The latter theory has many distin
guished supporters, of whom the most
eminent is perhaps Sir William Crooks,

For many years Meteor mountain
has been the subject of Indian tradi
tion.
Some Indian fiCRcndR.
The Mokis have a tradition of a
blazing star which fell ages ago. when
Old Man Coyote was a talking animal
and when the oldest of the abandoned
cliff houses In the southwest was new.
The legend tells how the Mokis had
offended the Great Spirit, and finally
a warning was sent in the shape of a
blazing star which lighted up the
earth for hundreds of miles around
and whose shock was so terrific that
several Moki villages were all but
ruined. The Mokis heeded the warn
ing, and since the falling of the blaz
ing star they have so walked in the
paths of rectitude that they are among
the favored people of Manitou.
Aside from mere curiosity and spec
ulation, the spot where the great me
teor fell was of little interest to hu
manity until a wandering sheepherd
er, who had been grazing his flocks In
the vicinity of Meteor mountain, pick
ed up a fragment of meteorite which,
besides meteoric Iron, proved to con
tain hard, black diamonds of great
value for mechanical purposes.
The earth In the vicinity of Meteor
ite mountain is strewn with fragments
evidently loosened from the main body
by the terrific impact as the heavenly
messenger struck the earth- The herd
er picked up a large fragment and
was about to toss it aside when its
great weight appealed to him as some
thing peculiar. He took it to camp
and turned it over to a collector, who
in turn took it to an eminent English
scientist.
Search was made for more frag
ments of meteorite in the vicinity of
Meteor mountain In the hope that
other discoveries of gems would re
sult. The sides of the mountain and
the desert for miles on all sides were
thoroughly prospected and enough

INTERESTING
Was the First Dublin Reunion
of the Daughters of
Erin
An interesting and attractive feature in
connection with the Irish language move
ment in Dublin was the reunion of the
members of the Daughters of Erin which
took place In the Derrybawn Hotel The
reunion was the first of its kind which
has been held since the society was
started in April last and the President
and the other members are to be con
gratulated upon the brilliant success
which attended their efforts upon the oc
casion The assembly was a large one
and included number of gentlemen As
was to be expected music figured very
prominently in the course of the inter
tainment and during the evening several
songs were admirably rendered the ma
jority of them being in Irish The pro
ceedings were opened by the reading of
a brief and interesting paper dealing with
the subject of the Goddess Brigid the
patroness of the society The paper was
read by the President Miss Maud Gonne
who in the course of her remarks related
a number of interesting legends which
have been woven around the name of this
mythical heroine of Celtic romance and
described at some length certain interest
ing ceremonies formerly observed in this
country in honor of the goddess whose
name typified all that was fair and just
and upright in the Irish character In
cidentally Miss Gonne mentioned that
one of the objects of the Society of the
Daughters of Erin was to endeavor to
create a general interest in the re
vival of those memories of Irish
heroes which bad been too long
alto io verwgi rt i
those memories still glimmered like
eelsome far off stars they owed that fact to
the great scholars abroad Those men
to whom they were under a lasting debt
of gratitude told them that the Celtic
legends were as beautiful as those of
Greece To Irish men and women they
should be more beautiful because they
were more in accordance with the deeds
of the Celtic race though In the past
they had not fostered these memories as
they might have done
ENCYCLICAL
Pope Leo Pleads That All
Turn to Christ For
Peace
Press dispatches from Rome announce
that the Pope has addressed to the Dish
ops an encyclical dated November 1 on
the Redeemer The Pontiff says he re
joices at the assemblage of Catholics from
all parts of the world in Rome during
holy year which he adds demonstrates
that the peoples arc marching toward
Christ He exhorts the world to seek
the Redeemer which the Pontiff points
out is the road to truth and life adding
As Christs coming to the world re
formed society so the latter in turning to
Christ will become better and be saved
by following his doctrines and divine
law by discountenancing revolt against
the constituted powers and avoiding con
flicts II
flictsIf
If the peoples acted so the encyclical
continues they would all love one an
other as brothers and obey their supe
riots Neglect of God the Pontiff further
says has led to so many disorders that
the peoples are oppressed with Incessant
fears and anguish He concludes with
urging the Bishops to make known to the
e tlre world that the Redeemer and
Savior of mankind alone can bring salva
tlion and peace

PROF SMITHS GREAT COLLECTION
If any one is so lucky as to find one of
the shooting stars which will fall in
the meteoric showers due the 13th and
14th of this month he may congratulate
himself on having captured a prize worth
its weight in gold The number of col

The largest and finest collection of me
teorites on this side of the Atlantic is the
one in the Harvard mineralogical museum
in Cambridge Reckoning European col
lections it ranks about fifth or sixth in
the world The principal part of the
Harvard collection was brought together
by one of the most distinguished of Amer
ican chemists the late J Lawrence Smith
of Louisville Ky whose specimens were
purchased by subscription in 1883 Prof
Smith himself being one of the subscrib
ets Calculating the comparative value of
collections of meteorites is something of
an art however A main point to be
taken into consideration is the number
of falls so called which are repre
sented Ordinarily perhaps each me
teoric mass which is found represents a
separate fall but often a meteorite splits
into several pieces falling fifty or 100
miles distant from one another on strik
ing the earths atmosphere The com
mon origin of such pieces is often demon
strated by analysis or by general appear
ance but more often perhaps it remains
in doubt

about 2800 pounds The largest mete

valuable Much depends on the matter
of control

A very large and famous meteorite is

with the recognized rule for naming me
teorites from the locality in Arizona
where it was discovered Here great
pieces of a thousand pounds or more can
be obtained by any one who wants them
fOr the trouble and expense of carting
them away In other words no one
controls it and it has little or no
money yalue On the other baud a
much smaller and less interesting mete
orite owned wholly orinainly by a single
cabinet is likely to be worth hundreds of
dollars A single small piece of some
notable meteorite thus held may easily
bring for example at the rate off75 or
1100 a pound The pound is much too
clumsy a standard for so valuable a ma
terial as meteoric stone or iron and the
weight of all specimens is recorded in
the catalogues in grams
A museum needs only to keep the bulk
piece of a meteorite to retain control of
it Other pieces it exchanges with other
collectors with a view to increasing rep
resentations of falls It is interesting to
note how carefully the weight and dis
tribution of these various pieces are set
down in museum records One of the
most celebrated meteorites in the Har
vard museum is Cynthiauia found in the
township of that name In Harrison county
Kentucky It weighed when found about
6000 grams of which 4772 grams are
provablethat is can be assigned to
different collections in various weights
Of this amount the two largest pieces
weighing 3113 and 539 grain respect
ively are retained by the university
while other pieces from a single gram to
upward of 400 are held for exchange

What can be more sacred more holy

which signifies that human life has been I
more highly valued in the production of
human commodities than the mere profits I

The label is an emblem of justice of

The union label is a religious em

to which this label is attached an act
blessed on earth and honored in heaven
while it is a sin to buy a cigar a piece of

not know but what you are building up

all of you as you leave this house tonight

UNFORTUNATE MAN ALMOST BLIND
The friends of Dennis Crowley
throughout the city of Louisville were +
all shocked Wednesday morning when
the announcement was made that his
dead body had been found upon the side
walk at Seventh and Oak streets the
result of a fall from a thirdstory window
in which his neck was broken
Mr Crowley was sixtyfive years old
and had for some time past been making
his home with his sou who resided in
the third story of the building occupied
by John Hickey The unfortunate man
was nearly blind his eyesight being
affected by cataracts from which he had
of recent years suffered considerably
The most plausible explanation of the
CrowleyE
arose at an early hour in the morning
and in attempting to leave his room fell
out of the thirdstory window which he
evidently mistook for the door leading
therefromThe
The first intimation of his death wall
when the body was soon afterward found
lying on the sidewalk by Officer Thomas
Brown while making his rounds
The remains were taken in charge by
Dougherty Keenan and the relatives
immediately notified Examination re
vealed the fact that death must have
been instantaneous
Dennis Crowley was among the older
residents of this city and was well known
and respected He came to Louisville
from Ireland many years ago and had led
a busy and useful life The remains were
prepared for burial and removed to the
home of John Crowley 2306 Second

I)o not forget that next Friday
evening, January 26th, the friends
of ""Max"" Wiley, who has been
incapacitated from being afflicted
with inflammatory rheumatism for
the past two months, give a benefit
for him, a perusal of the program
guarantees that everyone who at
tends will enjoy a very pleasant
evening's sport.
The program consists of singing,
dancing, boxing and wresting. King
Pierce will meet ""Kid"" Burns of
Butte in a six-round contest. These
boys are evenly matched, and as
there is an old grudge existing be
tween them a slashing bout will
result. I
George Odell will also mix mat
ters with ""Kid"" Densmore. Odell
needs no introduction to Tonopah
sport lovers as ha has performed
here several times, but ""Kid"" Dens
more comes here with a clean repu
tation and a long list of boxers
who -have been put away for the
count. Among the top-notchers
who went to defeat at. the hands
of this youngster are Clarence Eng
lish, Guy Ruckles and Jimmy Gard
ner of Lowell, Mass.
In the wrestling line, Patrick
Cannon, the well known mat artist,
has signified his willingness to
meet any six men In Tonopah In
one hour. All that the ""Terrible""
Irishman asks is that those who
wish to meet him will please leave
their name with the sporting edi
tor of the Bonanza before press
time on Thursday.
The singing and dancing will con
sist of the best local talent.
Jake Goodfriend has tendered the
Nevada theater free of charge, and
the entire receipts, minus the ex
penses incident to the benefit, will
go to the unfortunate man who
is at present a sufferer at, the Min

LARGE METEORITE STRIKES
IN THE VICINITY OF RENO
RENO, Nev., Jan. 23. Traveling
at a terrific speed and cutting a
streak of flaming red through the
morning sky, a meteorite fell near
Reno Sunday morning and when it
struck the earth it made a noise
like the explosion of a thirteen-lnch
gun, only more so. How many peo
ple saw this meteorite fall Is not
known, but Captain Gosse saw It
and be gives a graphic, description
of it.
Captain Gosse says that he had
traveled to the Title Gun club early
Sunday morning and had just set
tled himself comfortably In . the
blind and taken a drink from his
Thermos bottle, containing coffee,
when he heard a sort of hissing
sound and looked toward the south
east. There he saw this meteorite.

behind it in the heavens. The
meteorite itself seemed to be white,
so intense was its heat, but the
tall it made was red, a flaming red,
and It made a long red gash In the
sky like a gapping wound with th
life blood pouring out. Captain
Gossa watched this meteorite until
It fell, and he says that It struck
near the mountain which stands
out by Itself in the southeastern
end of the valley. There was a
loud report when It landed and the
meteorite probably exploded.
There was nothing to catch fire
from the flaming messenger of the

rival explorers and Professor Lewis
Lindsay Dyche of Kansas is the other.
Lieutenant Peary is more widely
known than Prof. Dyche, but in the
scientific world the latter is held in the
highest esteem. He has made several
trips to the Arctic region in search of
the pole, and on one occasion jour
neyed north with Lieutenant Peary
Something happened on that occasion
IOWA COI'NTV DEMOCRAT: MINEAL POINT. WISCONSIN, AUGUST IS. ISHS.
which caused an estrangement, and
now they arc anything but friends
When Lieutenant Peary returned a
year ago from his eventful trip to the
north Prof. Pyche wrote a long article
in which he showed that had it not
been for a scries of blunders made by
Peary the north pole would have been
discovered This, of course, did not
lessen the breach between the two.
When it was announced a short time
ago that Lieutenant Peary was going to
start on a journey to Melville bay to
bring back the great meteorite. Prof.
Pyche said nothing, but immediately
packed up and left his home at Law
rence, Kan. A week later the news
was given out that he was going to
bring back the meteorite. Pyche left
about the first of July, whereas Peary
did not leave unt’l July Id. On that
date he sailed in the steamer Hope
from Sydney, C. 8.. accompanied by a
number of scientists. Henson, the
famous black servant of Lieutenant
Peary, is one of the party; also Hugh
Lee, who accompanied Peary in ail of
his trips to the north. The scientists
are: Professors Alt' Burton and George
H. Barton, of the Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology; Russel \V. Porter,
a student in the architectural depart
ment of the Institute of Technology,
goes as artist and photographer, and
John C. Phillips, a student of Harvard,
as assistant geologist; Geologist (I. H.
Putnam, assistant in the United States
Coast and Geodetic survey, has been
detailed to take pendulum and mag
netic obervitions. Three scientific
parties will be landed at labrador.
South Greenland and Melville bay, re
snectively.
There is considerable mystery about
Prof. Dyche's trip. None of the detaib
of his plan have been given, but he If
known to be a man full of resource
who can make plans in ono minute and
oarry thorn out tn tho next There is
nothing very terrible about a trip to
Melville hay. as it dot's not require the
long preparations which a more pro
tracted journey to the north does Mel
ville bay has boon known to navigators
for more than 300 years, and it used
to ho a common stopping ground for
tho old whalers.
The last hoard of Dyche was at Seat
tle, whore it was said ho was to sail
for the north. He was to go through
Poring strait and the Northwest pass
age to Greenland This is a much
longer route u an that i..k<u I>> i'oaty.
but as the Kansas man had a start of
nearly two weeks, this should even
things up.
A year ago Professor Dyche said that
ho was going to try and roaoh the north
pole this summer, and it may he that
after disposing of the meteorite he will
push on to the north, lie is not a rich
man, and could not afford to defray the
espouse of such a Journey. hut it is
well known that a number of wealthy
men have stood ready for years to sup
ply the money ho would roipiiro for the
trip.
Some time ago when talking about
the meteor. of! Prof. Dyehe said: "" This
meteorite was llrst seen by Franklin,
to whom the natives showed it The
Rsquimaux have known it foT ages
They call it the ‘great iron stone.’ It
weighs forty tons and is composed of
solid iron mixed with a little nickel. It
probably fell out of the heavens count

The president practically lives out oi

UJS. Diplomats Worry About
Cuts In W. European Armies
By JOHN SCALI
WASHINGTON Grt—Top Ameri
can diplomatic officials were re
ported concerned today that West
ern European governments even
tually may follow the United
States' example and cut the size
of their armies.
Any sizable European manpower
reductions, it was felt, would up
set North Atlantic Treaty defense
plans for smashing possible Rus
sian invasion of the West “at the
threshold,"" as Secretary of State
Dulles put it at his news confer
ence yesterday.
Dulles said the United States has
no present intentions of pulling out
its six divisions now in Europe
even though this country has plans
to cut its armed manpower. And,
he said, it would be inconsistent
and unfortunate if European na
. tions also reduced their armed
forces.
He said that Western Europe,
with its vast industries and skilled
labor, is such a prize that an ag
gressor might gamble on a light
ning grab of this area, risking a
heavy retaliatory blow. That, he
said, is why larged armed forces
must be ready in Europe.
The defense of the Orient rep
resents a different problem, he
said. There the chief peril is from
Red subversion and the military
need is for fast-striking mobile
forces rather than big standing
armies.
In a formal statement, Dulles
said nuclear weapons will be in
troduced gradually in North At
antic Treaty Organization defense
preparations. He said the 14-na
tion decision to lean heavily on
nuclear power “shows for the frst
time the means of developing a
forward strategy which could be
relied on to protect Western Eu
rope from invasion.”
""As that capability is de
veloped,"" he continued, “it will
surely constitute the strongest de
terrent against military aggres
sion.""
Informed officials told a news
man Defense and State department
leaders do not believe there is
much danger European allies will
cut back their armies in 1955.
Hiey noted that at the 14-nation
North Atlantic treaty meeting in
Haris last weekend, all European
n)embers agreed to maintain their
present armed forces in the next
12 months and to concentrate on
sharpening their combat effective
ness. But these officials expressed
concern about future years.
European public pressure for de
fense cuts undoubtedly will mount
during the next year, they fear,
especially now that the U. S. De
fense Department has disclosed
plans to cut American manpower
by 403,000 in the next 18 months.
Dulles said the United States
actually will wind up stronger de
spite the manpower reductions be
cause of development of more
powerful weapons.
""The reductions are not due to
the fact that we consider that the
threat has diminished,"" he said,
“but merely due to the fact that
we think that we have other ways
to cope with that threat.”
Long Research
Goes Into
Making Film
Hollywood’s greatest production
wonder will always be the actual
putting onto film the product of a
scriptwriter’s imagination turning
words and ideas into concrete, vi
sible reality.
Ths is how it was done for one
of the more spectacular battle
scenes in Columbia Pictures’ “The
Black Knight,” Alan Ladd’s first
great spectacle adventure in color
by Technicolor at the Strand Thea
tre Thursday.
High on a hill-top. art director
\ etchinsky had constructed a grey
stone Druid’s Temple. Here a Sar
acen knight brings as captive,
Ladd’s co-star, Patricia Medina,
and some captured monks, to be
sacrificed by the Druids to their
gods. While attendant maidens
dance around the stones, and the
Druids and Saracens carouse, Pa
tricia is tied to the sacrificial
stone and the monks swing in wick
er baskets over bonfires.
The fires are lighted, and flames
leap up as Alan Ladd, the Black
Knight, rides in to the rescue, fol
lowed by King Arthur and his
Knights of the Round Table, re
splendent in blue tabards and gold
armor, their horses in blue.
A team of top stunt men sur
round Ladd in thick of the fight,
dying, riding and falling from rear
ing horses, while others are roast
ing in the wicker baskets over the
bonfires. In one almost too realistic
take, the basket in whcich one
stunt man swung caught fire, and
his monk’s robe began to smolder.
For mass hourse-riding scenes, a
unit of cavalry, some 70 - strong,
was used. These men are crack rid
ers, with horses in the pink of
condition.
From four to eight per cent of
human beings are left handed.
THE KEY WEST CULLEN
Mrs. Hodges
Fights For Her
Meteorite
By JAMES SPOTSWOOD
SYLACAUGA, Ala. W—Twenty
two days ago Mrs. Hulitt Hodges,
a plump, pleasant-faced matron of
31, lay down to take a little nap.
In the back of her mind was
a jumble of plans—visiting friends,
getting ready for Christmas, house
hold duties. But they could wait.
She had a cold and needed rest.
She dozed.
Then there was a thunerous
crash. She felt a violent blow on
her left arm and hip. Sunlight
shone through a hole in'the ceil
ing. A rough-edged black “rock""
lay near her.
She had been struck by a frag
ment of a shooting star which had
hurtled to the earth from outer
space. Scientists said she was the
first person in recorded history
known to be hit by a meteorite.
She still has to spend part of
each day in bed because of the
severe bruises she suffered. She
has nightmares, in which “it seems
like I hear the sound.""
She and her husband moved out
of their comfortable frame resi
dence to a smaller house after
her landlady Mrs. Birdie Guy filed
suit for the meteorite, for which
more than $5,000 has been offered.
Mrs. Guy’s lawyer said the Su
preme Court has held that a
meteorite belongs to the owmer of
the property on which it falls.
“The meteorite is personal prop
erty,” argues Atty. Huel M. Love
for Mrs. Hodges. “It didn’t come
to rest on Mrs. Guy’s property—
it came to rest on Mrs. Hodges
and on her studio couch.”
Both the Smithsonian Institution
and Alabama State Museum at
the University of Alabama want
the fragment, but the Smithsonian
says the meteorite itself isn’t worth
SSOO.
“Suing is the only way she’ll
ever get it,” said Mrs. Hodges of
Mrs. Guy’s suit. “I feel like the
meteorite is mine. I think God in
tended it for me. After all, it hit
me.""
The meteorite is in care of her
lawyer now.
Young Robinson
Wins Out Against
Robbery Charge
SANTA MONICA, Calif. OB - A
robbery case against Edward G.
Robinson Jr., 21, son of the actor,
has been dismissed.
He had been tried in November
but the jury disagreed, standing
11-1 for acquittal. Retrial had been
scheduled for Feb. 14 but yester
day the prosecution recommended
dismissal.
Superior Judge Allen T. Lynch
commented that “since the prose
cution has no more evidence it
would be extremely difficult to
convince another jury beyond a
reasonable doubt ai to the defend
ant’s guilt.”

Story About
Apaches Heads
Drive-In Bill
The momentous days when the
whole Southwest trembled under
the impact of 20,000 Apaches sweep
ing down the vengeance trail are
thrillingly re-created on the screen
in Columbia Pictures’ “Conquest of
Cochise,” opening Thursday at the
Island Theatre.
John Hodiak, in the title role as
the great Apache warrior, stars
with Robert Stack and Joy Page.
In “Conquest of Cochise,” short
ly after the war between Mexico
and the U. S., the border areas
are ravaged by raiding Apkches
and Comanches. Eventually, Co
chise, the great Apache chief,
comes forward to make his peace
with the u’hite man, symbolized to
him by Major Burke, U. S. Cav
alry officer. But the war drums
throb once again when Cochise
kills a Comanche chieftain raid
ing a Mexican ranch. Further fuel
is added to the fires when Cochise’s
wife is killed and the fleeing mur
derer leaves an American rifle.
The major, given four days to
prove that an American was not
responsible for the murder of Co
chise’s wife, produces the evidence
in time, but the Comanches im
patiently brush the restraining
Cochise aside and condemn him to
death at the tourture stake.
Companion feature for the show
ing “The Conquest of Cochise” will
be Paramount’s “A Place in the
Sun.”
This forceful and arresting
screenplay stars Montgomery Clift,
Elizabeth Taylor and Shelley Win
ters.
Sister Denies
Maxene Andrews
Tried Suicide
CHATSWORTH, Calif. W)—Max
ene Andrews of the singing An
drews Sisters, treated yesterday
for what police called an overdose
of sleeping pills, took them acci
dentally says her sister, LaVeme.
“Maxene loves life too much to
end it,” said LaVeme, adding that
her sister was “completely ex
hausted” from a recent tour
through Australia with LaVerne.
Neighbors quoted Maxene as say
ing she took the pills becase she
was despondent, police said.
“The housekeeper found her un
conscious and rushed her to the
hospital and in the excitement said
Maxene must have taken 18 pills,’’
LaVerne explained. “Later she
remembered there were only five
pills in the bottle.”
The sister act split up last year.
Patty now is singing solo in Las
Vegas, Nev.
Last night Maxene had recovered
sufficiently to return home and
wrap Christmas packages.

Military To Prune Many From Koster
By C. YATES McDANIEL
WASHINGTON on—’The military
services have been told to start
pruning 403,000 from their present
over-all strength to reach the 2,-
815,000-man level the administra
tion thinks is about right for the
current cold war.
In disclosing a manpower cut
back program Monday, Secre
tary of Defense Wilson said it will
be accompanied by a 50 per cent
slash in draft calls starting in
February, when the announced
quota of 20,000 is to be dropped to
10.000 or 11,000. Quotas have been
running about 20,000 for many
months.
Wilson said an improved situa
tion in the Far East and “better
opportunities for peace” every
where entered into President Ei
senhower’s decision to trim the
services.
Only the Air Force, which will
continue its gradual buildup to
975,000 men in the next 18 months,
escapes the trimming.
In the same period—that is, by
June 30, 1956—the Army will drop
25 per cent of its current strength
to level off at an even one million.
The Navy is down for a 6 per cent
cut from present strength to reach
£50,000- and the Marine Corps will
drop 14 per cent to 190,000. Over-all
strength for all services last month
was 3,218.000.
There was no immediate reac
tion from members of Congress,
but the decision seemed likely to
stir some controversy. A number
of Democrats have complained
that the nation’s military might
is already dangerously weak.
The reduction spelled out by
Wilson both revived and spesdgd
up by a full year a program set
aside by the Pentagon only last
year because of the crisis in Indo
china and a threatening situation
around Formosa.
The Army, Navy and Marine
Corps will lose by next June
107,000 uniformed people they have
money to maintain under the cur
rent budget. They will have to drop
an additional 130,000 in the 12
months starting next July.
The new program calls for the
early return home from Korea of
the Ist Marine Division and the
eventual move of one regiment of
the 3rd Marine Division from Ja
pan. Some of the slack will be
taken up temporarily by the shift
of an Army division, one of two
now in Japan, to Korea. The net
result of these moves will be to
leave the equivalent of four Amer
ican divisions in the two Far East
nations. The Army will continue

Fliers Ride Radar Fence
HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah
Iff*—Like cowboys riding fence, a
team of fliers here goes out al
most daily to check the invisible
radar fence that helps guard the
United States against air attack.
The mission of the 4677th Radar
Fvaulation Flight was disclosed in
Washington Tesday by the Air
Force. The unit has been stationed
at Hill AFB. near Ogden, for about
a year. There are only two others
like it in the country—one at Ham
ilton AFB, Calif., and one at Grif
fis AFB. N. Y.
Maj. James A. Gerwick. a big,
ruddy-cheeked man, is the Hill
unit’s commander
Describing his job, he searches
for precise terms.
“I think the best way to ex
press it.” he said, “is that we
tty to determine radar coverage.
We need to know just how much
territory our radar network takes
in.”
To do this job, Gerwick has nine
airplanes in his flight—seven 8295,
one 825 and one C 47.
His men “ride fence” for the
Central Air Defense Area, which
includes 28 states in the middle
of the country and stretches from
Mexico to Canada.
The radar testers fly around the
clock, winter and summer, going
out beyond the border and then
swinging back through the network.
Ordinarily the pilot doesn't know
whether he has been spotted by
to keep the equivalent of six divi
sions in Europe.
The Army will decide whether
it can maintain its division total,
now 19, under the cutback. Wilson
said the Navy might have to lay
up a few ships and man the re
maining ones with fewer men.

Rejected by
Alaska Airlines
By FRANK W. VAILLE
WASHINGTON, CP)—Alaska Air
lines Friday rejected a proposed
merger offer by Pacific Northern
Airlines and talk between the two
Alaska carriers are off—at least
temporarily.
A. G. Woodley, Pacific presi
dent, and H. W. Robinson, chair
man of the Alaska board, told a
newsman, however, they consid
ered the do'or open for further
discussions — possibly late this
week.
Woodley, who earlier had re
jected an Alaska proposal, said he
considers the “next move” to be
Alaska’s.
“Robinson said they might think
it over and return next week,”
Woodley added.
Robinson said he feels both
sides are “really trying to reach
an agreement” and “neither side
has exhausted all the possibilities
by a long shot.”
He said:
“We made them an offer and
they rejected it; now we’ve re
jected theirs.”
Neither Robinson nor Woodley
would disclose details of the dis
cussions. Woodley said the two
carriers have “agreed to keep the
gory details out of the paper.”
The Civil Aeronautics Board
examiner has recommended that
Pacific be granted a seven-year
renewal of its authority to fly
between Seattle and Anchorage
but that renewal of Alaska’s
authority to fly from Seattle to'
Portland to Fairbanks be found
“not in the public interest.”
The examiner also said that in
tegration of the two systems
would bo in the public interest.
His recommendations are subject
to approval by the board.

U.S. Accuses Russia
Of Willful Lying
On Shot Down B-50
WASHINGTON, UP)—The United
States Saturday accused Russia of
having “willfully and knowing
ly” lied about the shooting down
of an American B-50 bomber over
the Sea of Japan in July, 1953. It
filed a formal damage claim for
$2,785,492.94.
At the same time the United
States challenged Russia—if the
Communists deny liabilities for
the damages—to join in taking
the dispute to the International
Court of Justice.
Ambassador Charles E. Bohlen
delivered the 17-page American
not to the Soviet Foreign Office
in Moscow Saturday.
In Washington, the State De
partment made the note public
and announced that U. N. Ambas
sador Henry Cabot Dodge Jr. has
been instructed to circulate the
text among the members of the
U.N. Security Council.
It was the second time that the
12-POUND METEORITE
FALLS IN SIBERIA
LONDON, UP)—Moscow Radio
reported Saturday a meteorite
weighing around 12 pounds fell
last month near the village of
Krutinka in Omsk Province of
western Siberia. The broadcast
said a government expert had
been sent to examine the meteor
ite, the second reported in Russia
this year.
United States resorted to this ex
traordinary procedure in pressing
what is clearly a campaign to get
satisfaction from the Soviet Union
for the destruction of American
aircraft. The first instance was
two weeks ago when Washington
asked some \Vt million dollars
for a B-29 shot down off northern
Japan in October, 1952.
There have been a number of
cases where Soviet fighters at
tacked U.S. planes near Russian
borders.
The incident in Saturday’s for
mal diplomatic note occurred on
July 29 last year and resulted in
16 Americans dead or missing.

FRIDAY. JULY 3. IS.W.
BABY’S COHING.
Nature intended that
every woman should
look forward Io the com
ing of her baby with joy
and hope, unclouded by
anxiety. Almost pain
less parturition is quite
the usual thing among
uncivilized people.
Even in our own country
it occasionally happens
with women in robust
health and good condi
tion. It ought to be the
rule instead of the excep
tion ; and it is a fact that
a very large proportion
of the usual pam and suf
fering may be avoided by
looking after the mother’s general health,
and specially strengthening the particular
organs concerned in parturition. .
Many mothers have been brought through
the trying time almost painlessly by the aid
of Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription. It
prepares the system for delivery by im
parting the organic strength and elasticity
which the mother specially needs; shortens
the time of labor and of confinement; pro
motes the secretion of abundant nourish
ment Yor the child and fortifies the entire
constitution against the after period of de
pression and weakness. It's use should
begin in the early months of gestation—the
earlier the better.
Mrs. Fred Hunt, of Glenville. Schenectady Co ,
N. Y., says: “ I read about Dr. Pierce’s Favonte
Prescription being so good for a woman with
child, so I got two bottles last September, and
December 13th, I had a twelve-pound baby girl.
When I was confined I was not sick in any wav
I did not suffer any pain, and when the child
was born I walked Into another room and went
to bed. I never had an after-pain or any other
pain. This is the eighth child and the largest
of them all. I suffered everything that flesh
could suffer with the other batxes. I always had
a doctor and then he could not help me very
much but this time my mother and my hustand
were alone with me. My baby was only sjven
days old when I got up auddxssed and left my
room and stayed up all day.”

TYfE PEDAL CLARIONET.
Nvmethlng Entirely New In the Line of
Musical Instruments.
When the next season of grand opera
opens, lovers of the music of Wagner,
Beethoven and Mozart, as rendered by
metropolitan orchestras, may be sur
prised at an tfnusual instrument which
will be seen in the orchestra. The field
of music has in the past been so thor
oughly gone over by the old masters
that about the only hope for the modern
musician who wishes to avoid the charge
Of plagiarism is in the devising of some
new instrument for use in orchestras
which shall add a new sonorousness to
music already familiar to the audience.
Almost all combinations have been
tried again in the effort to find some-
thing new in the way of melody, and
since the time of Palestrina the study
of inharmonious and discordant combi
nations have been studied with as great
a zest as ever was harmony. It is with
Ulis knowledge of the effects of discord
lifter intervals of harmony that a num
ber of ne w and decidedly unique instru
ments for orchestral purposes have been
devised.
First and foremost among these freak
instrument creations is a pedal clario
net, which has this advantage over the
ordinary clarionet, that it has a much
lower and consequently heavier reach,
being heavy in tone and adding materi
ally to the power of the orchestra. It
is a combination of the clarionet and
the sexaphone. The fingering is thte
same as in the 13-keyed clarionet. Small
metal plates instead of the customary
rings are used, however, thus securing
a more perfect and complete system of
stops than in the ordinary clarionet.
While in tone the pedal clarionet is mel
low and full, there re an unexpected
softness and at the same time a force
uneaualed bv any. other instrument.
DAZZLING GEMS.
Nall Dealer Who Cut. a Da.h with Illi
Baeoeaslul idea.
Boston has a Barney Baraato who
simply dazzles his Chicago customers
every time he calls upon them. This he
does about six times a year. He is a
young man of fine appearance and large
frame. Diamonds, emeralds and rubies
blaze at.various points over his elegant
ly-attired person, and it is notan uncom
mon thing to see a 51,000 treasury note
peeping conspicuously from each of his
vest pockete.
He sweeps up to the place of business
of his customers and makes his way
with stately self-possession to the office
of the president or proprietor. Some
of his customers insinuate that his
bizarre ways are for advertising pur
poses, but, if such is the case, they ad
mit three-sheet posters could do it no
better. This individual is a favorite,
however, among wholesale hardware
merchants on Lake street and vicinity,
as his presence is ever refreshing. Mr.
Pearson—for that is his name—is a
chining example of the value of adapt
ing an idea. While in England some
years ago he discovered a process for
coating nails with a chemical cement.
This made them as valuable for hold
fast purposes as carefully threaded
screws which cost ten times as much.
He bought the patent for America and
is reaping a fortune. He had 150,000
kegs of nails on hand when the trust
boosted prices, and by this alone cleared
■nearly $200,000.
His method is to contract with a nail
mill for standard nails on his specifica
-tions. These specifications make the
nail of lighter gauge than regular sizes.
In -this way a keg containing anywhere
from 55 to 95 pounds will hold as many
nails as the standard 100-pound keg.
The cement covering makes the lighter
nail superior to the heavier for holdfast
purposes, besides being water and rust
proof.
RACE FOR A METEORITE.
BuzpectcE Object of Prof. Dyche’. Hadden
Departure for the North.
It is possible that there is an object
that does not appear on the surface of
the sudden departure for Alaska of
Prof. L. L. Dyche, of the Kansas state
university.
During his northern trip last sum
mer the professor paid-a visit, while in
Greenland, to the largest meteorite in
the world, and immediately announced
his determination to possess it. Lieut.
Peary, however, claimed the meteorite
by right of discovery, and warned the
professor not to attempt to remove it.
As the meteorite weighs dozens of tons,
Peary’s warning was of necessity heed
ed at the time, but Prof. Dyche stated
distinctly that he intended within a
few years to return to Greenland for
the meteorite.
Recently disnatches announced that
1.1#: t. reary'would Fail Tor Ureeifland
this summer to secure the meteorite.
A/ soon as Prof. Dyche can reach Seat
-111 he, too, will sail for the north, and
it is quite probable that his destination
is'neither Alaska nor the north pole,
but the/point, in Greenland where the
coveted meteorite lies.
Prof. Dyche will have the longer
route through Behring straits and the
northwest passage, but he is a man of
•great energy and if he has in reality
started on a race for the coveted mete
orite the chances arc in favor of a lively
race to Greenland.
The meteorite is roughly estimatrd
to be worth $50,000.
X RAYS IN DIAGNOSIS.
Dr. Schmidt'* Laboratory Solving Many
Problems.
The physicians of Chicago are taking
liberal Advantage of the X ray labora
tory which Dr. O. L. Schmidt has fitted
out for the purpose of turning the
Roentgen discovert' to account in
diagnosing disease. The laboratory
was established three months ago. Dr.
Schmidt is of the faculty of the North
western Medical school and the Chicago
Polyclinic. Associated with him are
Dr. F. C. Harnisch, formerly assistant at
the University of and Paul
Bracht, photographer. The voltage is
furnished by a 12-inch spark coil with
25 miles of wire, capuule of supplying
GOO,OOO volts for ordinary service.
Many interesting subjects have been
photographed at the laboratory.
Physicians have been greatly aided in
locating bullets, exposing peculiar con
ditions of bone and sinew, and in several
instances have secured explanations of
mysterious conditions which have
baffled medical skill. Heretofore it has
required an hour or more for an ex
posure. Dr. Schmidt has reduced the
time to five minutes for a hand, ten
minutes for an elbow, and other parts cf
the anatomy in proportion.
Where Winter Lingers.
A letter from Norway, Me., under
date of May 19, to the Portland Argus
says: The snow is still two feet deep,
and the ice on the ponds strong enough
to hold up an Oxford bear in some parts
of the county. At Greenwood there is
a snowdrift which is reported to be
more than two feet deep, and which
seldom disappears before June 1. The
ice on Muskrat pond, beteween Rox
bury and Byron, is strong enough to
bear a man, and is surrounded with
snow. In Township D there is said to
be considerable snow in the deep, heavi
ly wooded gulches.
Connecticut Oy»ter Trade.
Those conversant with t he seed oyster
business in Connecticut say that the
season which is now at its height is the
best for the last five years. It is esti
mated that 1,000,000 of Connecticut seed
oysters will be sold.
Odd Fate of a Pigeon.
The lake vessel Thomas Davidson,
which arrived in South Chicago the
other day, had on board a dead pigeon
which had fallen into the smokestack.
It had evidently flown too near and had
been overcome by the coal gas.
Hea Serpents Already on Tap.
Sea serpents have begun to turn tip

HEADLESS BIRD.
Young Quail Whose Neck Had Been
Wrung Flies Away.
A gentleman living near this place
recently netted a dozen quails, says si
Taylor dispatch to the Philadelphia
Times. When he was kiling and dress
ing them the following strange occur
rence transpired: As he went to wring
the neck of one of the birds the head
slipped off in his hand, pulling about
t'.vo inches of skin and feathers along
•with it.
Turning a moment later to pick up
the bird from where he had thrown it,
the gentleman found the little fellow
flying and hopping about as though
nothing untoward had happened, his
bare neck sticking up gaunt and head
less.
Thinking the bird’s activity resulted
from a posthumus contraction of the
muscles the gentleman attempted to
pick him up, when the little fellow
mounted in the air and flew away, flut
tering and quivering now and then, but
when about 200 yards from the house
he disappeared into a small pine thicket,
flying to the last. . '
Muscular King.
A king with a strong arm is King
Carlos of Portugal. Once upon a time
in the not long ago he went out hunt
ing. His horse took fright and rushed
headlong down the mountain, down
toward a frightful precipice. A few
y ards more and horse and rider would
be dashed to pieces. But up rose the
king in his stirrups and brought his
iron fists down on the poor beast's head
with—well—with a whack. The horse
dropped as i* struck by lightning ami
the rider was safe.

eclipse of the sun and some exploration of the
moon’s surface would take about a month.
What kind of power, or fuel, will be needed
ships that can cover the nearly 500.000
tWes to the moon and back? No one quite knows,
but a century of research seems capable of devel
oping some potent fuel now unknown. It is even
possible that in the new-found release of atomic
energy from the rare isotope of uranium known
as 1' 2.15, science already has the fuel it needs.
This I’ 2.15 is millions of times as powerful
pound for pound —as Is coal that now furnishes
one of man’s greatest sources of power. Perhaps
a century of engineering research on how to uti
lize the vast quantities of atomic energy stored
up in U 235 will supply the answer to rocket fuel.
Atomic power is a complicated thing for even
scientists to understand, but Dr. W. F G. Swann,
director of the Parted Research Foundation of the
Franklin Institute, has explained it with a simple
analogy for the readers of The American Weekly.
“Suppose,” says Dr. Swann, “that we visualize
a tremendous country inhabited by great numbers
iif people of super-strength. There is almost
lnlimited potential power and force in this nation,
mt the people merely go about their business in
piiet and orderly fashion, doing not much of
mything except the mere business of keeping alive.
Then suppose that an agitator comes into Ibis
•ountrv, someone who stirs the people up. They
revolt and break out in tremendous force.
""Something very much like this hapjtens in
he case of atomic power. There is almost un
believable power stored up in a substance like the
iranium isotope U 235. When a neutron (a neutral
itomic particle) is introduced into the substance,
t is like introducing an agitator among the
irstwhile quiet people of super-strength: there is
i ‘revolution,’ and the power is released.""
The energy liberated when a uranium atom
ixnlodes is tremendous. A pound of uranium can.
r Aeory. liberate as much energy as would
pounds of coal if it were burned.
The atomic energy from uranium, it may thus
>p seen, provides a compact but terrifically
powerful fuel for a rocket ship. So new is the
iiscovery of the release of uranium’s atomic
nergy that the details and engineering develop
nent of how to harness it have not yet been
corked out. But at the speed and intensity of
nodern research it is quite probable that these
ire.-ent difficulties of application will be solved
ong before another 100 years have elapsed.

are so “geared” that

The great areas on
the mi win’s face have
been accurately mapped
out by science and it
can certainly be said
that rocket explorers
to the moon, a century
hence, will have vastly
more knowledge about
their goal than did Co-,
lumhus when he set sail
on his famous voyage
to America in 1492.
Two bold types of
features mark the face
of the moon as seen
from the earth with
large telescopes. These
are the great craters
and the “seas."" The lat
ter owe their name to
the erroneous concep
tions of early astrono
mers' who iooked at
them with extremely
small telescopes and
thought they resembled
very large lakes or
bodies of water. Thus the geography ot the moon
ir. filled with such fanciful names as the ""Sea of
Serenity” “Sea of Crises"" and “Sea of Show
ers."" Now’ it is know’n that these seas w'ere non
existent, but the old names were retained anyway.
The craters of the nunm were first assumed
to be true volcanic craters, and enthusiastic but
over-imaginative observers from time to time re
ported seeing eruptions. A careful watch has long
since disclosed that these craters are not now’
volcanic, if they ever were. Their origin is still
quite a mystery.
One difficult thing to explain about the craters
is the giant size of some of them. The crater of
Copernicus, to choose only one example, is 60
miles in diameter; some are even larger.
Another possible explanation of the craters
is that they are the pockmarks on the moon's face
caused by meteorites. Craters, due to meteorites,
are knowm on the earth’s surface.
Meteorites are chunks of rock or iron-nickel
which whirl into the region of the earth from outer
space. More and more it is being proved that they
consist of fragments of comets which have broken
up and wander around the sun in greatly elon
gated orbits.

Mostly meteors are tiny specks of matter, prob
ably no larger than a grain of sand. As they streak
into the earth’s atmosphere they meet, for the first
time in perhaps thousands or millions of years
something other than empty interplanetary space.
Rushing at a s|>ced of many miles a second
these tiny specks of matter have enormous energy
stored up in them due to their motion. This kinetic
energy, as it is called, turns into heat energy on
contact with the earth's surrounding belt of air.
Soon the meteor is heated to glowing incandescence
. and w’atchers on the earth see it flare up into the
familiar “shooting star.”
No danger to the earth are mere meteors. What
may form the hazard are the larger chunks of
matter that are large enough to survive their trial
by fire as they plunge through the air and strike
the earth. Some of these meteorites, as they are
designated, weigh many tons.
At Meteor Crater in Arizona in the distant past
a giant meteorite struck and has tom a huge hole
in the desert landscape. This crater is 4.000 feet
across and is still 500 feet deep despite the ravages
of erosion which have gradually filled up the bot
tom of the crater. The close resemblance in ap
pearance of this Arizona crater, to the smaller

craters on the moon, is the greatest reason for
thinking that the moon craters, too, have been
caused by meteorites. Certain it is that because
the moon lacks an atmosphere the impact of the
meteorites on the moon w’ould be greater for a
given size of object, than w'ould the impact on the
earth of a comparable meteorite. Moreover, be
cause the pull of gravity is so much less on the
moon than it is on the earth, a meteorite crashing
on the moon w'ould hurl material farther and give
the appearance of doing more damage than it
would on the earth.
Still scientists shake their heads when asked
to picture a huge meteorite which could create a
crater of 60 and more miles in diameter. Yet, if
the craters on the moon are to be explained by
this cause there are many questions still un
answered.
Many moon craters, as one troublesome puzzle,
are not really craters at all in so far as the inside
of the ring is concerned. Inside of the crater the
pitted moon surface is filled up with material so
that the center of the crater ring is a mile or two
above the plain outside the ring. This looks more
.like a volcano than a crater. Moreover, some
craters have a central peak with sloping walls
that look like rock slides.
Some moon craters appear to have a rim that
is 10.000 feet above the surrounding plain. The
floor of these craters is depressed 15.000 feet
below' the rim and the central peak may be 10.000
feet above the crater's floor.
There is strong evidence that lava flow's have
occurred over the rims of the craters on to the sur
face of the moon nearby. The great “seas” of the
moon are now’ believed to consist of large areas of
ooee-molten, flowing lava that has now’ turned to
lava rock. Studies of the light reflected off the
moon support this view for such light is much like
that W’hich is reflected off volcanic rock, or pumice.
It is probable that the moon’s surface is cov
ered to a depth of several inches with such volcanic
dust. Men from the earth who might walk over
such layers would probably stir up great clouds
of dust. These dust clouds would disappear almost
instantly, the particles falling back to the surface
as quicky as a large stone w’ould fall because of the
lack of atmosphere to hold them up. Of life on the
moon there can be none for there is no air or water
present.
There is one lunar feature which has defied
explanation despite four centuries of observation
through telescopes by man on earth. This is the
strange white ray, or streak. Systems of such
streaks surround certain craters on the moon—
notably the crater of Tycho.
Nothing stops these streaks. They run over
mountains, through valleys, and across the seas

£iclos which come to our earth from the inter
ar regions and perhaps from beyond the bor
of our Milky Way system. En route they
could pick up any infinitesimal hitch-hiker that
happened to be floating around.
The 15-mile thick buffer of air that surrounds
our globe protects us from the harmful effects of
many rays, and may also slow them down suf
ficiently to bump off their hitch hikers, if any.
Rut Professor Bachman points out that germs
which reach the fringe of our stratosphere might
just as well 1*» in our noses and throats, because
the air will carry them-there eventually.
Other scientists have demonstrated that some
organisms could survive the hazards of such a
ride through frozen stellar space.
At the University of Leyden in Holland, where
the Nobel Prize scientist, Professor Kamerlingh
Onnes, maintains his famous cold laboratory’, vari
ous forms of organisms have been immersed in
flasks of liquid air for close to two years at 330
degrees below’ zero. And when they emerge! they
were Just as alive as ever. This cold approximates
the temperature of stellar space, ranging from
346 to 459 degn*es below’ zero.
Professor B. J. Luyet, of the St. Louis Univer
sity School of Medicine, believes that the secret
of preservation of an organism in extreme cold
is quick freezing—the same sort of process which
is already being used to protect fruits and vege
tables from decay and bring them to your table
virtually as fresh as when they were harvested.
Experiments have shown that organisms in which
life has been suspended by quick-freezing can
survive incredibly low temperatures.
This resistance to cold is vital, whether the
germ rides on a wave, as Dr. Bachman believes,
or comes here in a meteorite, as Prof. Lundmaik
theorizes. We think of meteorites as being un
bearably hot, and so they are when they first
strike the earth. But the heat, generated by
friction, is all on the outside. After all, the trip
through our atmosphere is only a matter of
seconds. A few- minutes after a meteorite lands,
the internal cold overcomes the heat and the
exterior is likely to be covered with frost.
exponent of the meteorite • travel
theory is Professor Charles B. Lipman of the
university of California. He has collected meteor
ite fragments, thoroughly sterilized them on the
outside, then ground thVm up and put them in
special culture dishes to favor the growth of any
bacteria that might be present.
And bacteria grow in those dishes. Professor
Lipman thus is positive that life from another
world, perhaps one destroyed in some cosmic
tragedy long before our little ball of matter known

Recent Discoveries Tend to Confirm the Ancient Belief That Ravaging Epidemics like the Biblical
Plague of David Which Killed 70.000 in Three Days Came Floating Down From the Sky. And Lest —
So Devastating Were Rim Plagues and So Impossible to Combat Even Into Modern Times, That
Smitten Communities Drowned Their Terror In Any Way They Might.
as the earth was even a glow on the celestial
horizon, has been regenerated before his eyes.
If any of these theories of interplanetary germ
exchange can lx* definitely established, they may
answ’er many questions that puzzle medical men
about the great epidemics of history.
Today, with planes flitting from continent to
continent in a few hours, it is easy enough to
understand how’ some diseases might spread rap
pidly. But in primitive times, when few’ men trav
eled in a lifetime the distance that some commut
ers travel dally, new afflictions seemed to appear
almost simultaneously in widely separated parts
of the known world.
Germ bearing meteorites would explain this
phenomenon. Sir Richard Gregory, noted British
scientist, estimates that not fewer than 400.000.000
of these meteors, some only the size of a fleck of
dust, strike the earth’s atmosphere daily.
When the smaller pieces come Into our atmos
phere, at speeds of many miles per second, the
friction generates so much heat that they flare
up and Iwcorne a puff of gas. It is this brilliant
incandescence that makes humanity call them
shooting stars.
Any germs that these fragments might contain
w’ould, of course, be destroyed, even though some
organisms can demonstrably withstand almost as
much heat a* cold. But the larger meteorite
j>artleles either continue on through to the earth
or, in most cases, explode.
IN EXPLODING, they act much like bombs, scat
■ tering small bits of themselves over an area
of several miles. These minute fragments then
float slowly to the ground. And, tiny as they
are, each flake could harbor enough bacteria to
kill thousands of persons.
But when the nature of the cosmic cloud
changes, or whop stray fragments from a comet
arrive from the void, a different kind of bacteria
would be deposited in our midst. Scientists believe
this might explain how we hapjx'n to have so
many different forms of animalcula—why some
kinds of germs, for example, have to have oxygon
to live, while others die when they come in contact
with it. New forms of plant life, too, might arrive
in spores which are as small and hardy as germs.
A puzzling phase of the interplanetary germ
theory’ is the fact that no germs are known that
can survive bombardment by primary’ and sec
ondary cosmic rays at least until these rays
have been tam<*d by the earth’s atmosphere.
That is where quick freezing comes in. For,
science has found that if freezing can be induct'd
fast enough, the fluid in the germ cells enters a
vitreous state, in which it is still a liquid with
the properties of a solid.
Other experiments have shown that organisms
in which life has been suspended by such a
process can endure an amazing amount of abuse.
Piercing radiations which are found beyond our
atmosphere, and which are lethal to living matter
in its normal lorm, might w’ell prove harmless
to creatures during a suspension of animation.
At the University of Bonn, in Germany, be
fore the war, animals in a latent state were sub-*
jected for days to radiations from X-ray tubes
which would have killed them in three minutes
under normal circumstances.
In another test, no less a flier than Charles A.
Lindbergh took several forms of bacteria as high
Into the stratosphere as he could fly, and exposed
them to whatever radiations might be present.
When he returned to earth, microscopic exam
ination determined that the bacteria were just
as active as ever.
Even the best of modem research has been
unable to account for the sudden appearance and
amazing spread of the influenza virus. If such
a malignant organism existed on our earth the
early part of this century’, bacteriologists are un
able to understand why it did not make its pres
ence known in the form of earlier epidemics.
It is a recognized medical fact that the human
system can build up an Immunity against most
germs. The germs of the common cold, which
have yet to lx* identified w’ith’ certainty, bring
misery’ to as many as 23.000,000 Americans annu
ally', but rarely cause death.
Yet, they can be lethal to forms of life which
are new’ to them, as experiments frequently have
shown and as H. G. Wells brought out in his fa
mous “War of the Worlds,*’ in which invaders
from Mars were able to resist all weapons, but
succumbed to the little germs that merely give
us a running nose.
There are no indications that the bubonic
plague, or Black Death, existed on our globe
previous to the fourth century before Christ.
'Then, suddenly and inexplicably, It appeared spo
radically in widely separated areas.
INURING the last visit of Halley’s comet in
U i9io, its tail swept the earth, and there was
speculation as to what the result might be.
Nobody advanced the theory that the tail might
contain bacteria as well as dust germs, nor is
there any scientific proof that it did.
Yet in the years Immediately following there
was a wave of Spanish influenza that swept the
United States as well as Europe.
This, like the present milder wave of the same
disease, was attributed to.<?ondirtons arising from
war. .Still, it is possible that some scientist of the
future, pursuing the line of research suggested by
Profs. Bachman and Lundmark, will prove the
existence of a bond between comet and epidemic.
It will be up to other future scientists, if they
can, to devise some kind of defense that will
protect us from the bombardments of these deadly
missiles from other worlds.
Meantime, humanity can extract some bitter
comfort from the certainty that, If we are being
pelted with germs from other planets, so, too, are
we broadcasting our germs which our planetary
neighbors no doubt find just as unpleasant to
them as arc th”>s to us.

Castro'sArrival in
and
Paris,
His Habits There
PARIS, Dec. 12. President Castro's
arrival in Paris is hailed with ironical
curiosity. A group of policemen, de
tectives, journalists and half a dozen
daintily gowned Parisian women stood
on the platform when his train came
to a stop, and one of these women ex
claimed, as Castro stepped from his car,
""Mon Dieu! How ugly he is! "" The
diminutive President wore an enormous
pearl gray felt hat. He was tightly
truttoned up in a dark overcoat, and
his shot-s were of brilliant patent leath
er, with thick India rubber soles. He
walked with difficulty, and supported
himself with a very large gold-headed
cane. .On his finger was a ring with a
huge solitaire diamond. His face is
deep yellow, his under jaw is firm and
heavy, like that of a bulldog, and his
black 'eyes sparkle with maliee.
He stopped at the Palais D 'Orsay
Hotel, because it was feared that he
mighrhave a hostile reception, and this
being a railway, terminus hotel no pas.
sage through the streets was required.
As he walked from the station into the
station entrance of the hotel he looked
in dismay at the rolling mechanical
stairway, which he carefully avoided
and took the ordinary stairs. He was
preceded byjhis wife and daughter, and
walked alone at some distance ahead
of the rest of the .party, but when his
brother approached nearly to his side he
saLi to him abruptly in Portuguese, ""It
is I, not you, who am President. You
must walk five paces behind me.""
Immediately upon Mme. Castro's ar
rival six employes of - a prominent
dressmaking establishment ofMhe Rue
de la Pais ealled with a number of
large boxes filled with costly gowns,
which had teen ordered beforehand
by cable.
Castro pays little attention to the
three physicians who accompany Lim,
and his repasts are almost Gargantuan,
consisting of boiled turbot, pate de foie
gras, truffled pheasants, saddle of lamb,
and all sorts of delicacies and sweet
meats. He drinks copiously of the
finest wines, such, for instance, as Mou
ton Rothschild claret of 1875, Chateau
Yquem, Romance, Comte Burgundy and
brandy dating from 1830.
Parisians scarcely credit the report
that he is preparing for a surgical op
eration, and hint that the immediate
operation that he has in view is of a
financial nature, and is a proposition
to try to obtain a monopoly- in Europe
for the sale of Venezuelan cigarettes.
One of the conditions imposed by the
French government for tolerating his
presence in Paris, after his iguomin
ious expulsion from. Venezuela of the
V:
French minister and the consuls, is that
he shall make no communications to
the press. His personal safety, in view
of the numerous threats of assassina
tion from relatives of Venezuelan vic
tims of his tyranny, now in Paris, is
assured by a complete service of po
licemen and detectives. Meanwhile it
is expected that he will make the first
move toward according satisfaction for
his insults to France and to French
diplomatic and consular officials in
Venezuela, which resulted some years
ago in the severance of all relations be
tween France and Venezuela.

THEN THE ARTIST FLEW.
The struggling artist with the strag
gling locks had brought his masterpiece
for the approval -of the great collector,
J and was now awaiting his decision.
, ""It is not a bad representation of
the"" interior of a coal mine,"" said the
patron of talent.
""Sir,"" said the artist, ""it is not in
tended to be a coal mine. You are
looking at the back of the picture.
There, now,"" he continued, as he turn
ed it around. ""A birdseye view of the
city!""
The collector looked at him sternly.
""If your picture represents a birds
eye view of anywhere, all I can say Is
that I am thankful I am not a bird!""
. AN ASTRONOMICAL PUZZLE.
One of our best known astronomers
was talking the other day about the
difficulties and intricacies that astrono
my presents to the lay mind.
""For instance,"" he said, smiling,
""there is the story of the meteorite
that fell on a farm some years ago.
""It was a valuable meteorite, and
the landlord claimed it at once. 'All
minerals and metals on the land belong
to me,' he said. 'That's in the lease.'
""But the tenant demurred. ""This
meteorite,' he said, 'wasn't on the
farm, you must remember, when the
lease was drawn 4ip.'
""This was certainly a poser, but the
landlord was equal to the occasion, for
he promptly retorted. 'Well, then, I
claim it as flying game.'
""But the tenant was ready for him.
'It's got neither wings nor feathers,'
he said; 'therefore as ground game it's
mine.'
""How long they would have contin
ued their argument I cannot say, for
at that moment a revenue officer came
up and proceeded to take possession of
the meteorite, 'because,' said he, 'it is
an article introduced into this country
without payment of duty.' "" The List

Sir Oliver Lodge, the English scien
tist, learned to play golf at St. An
drews thirty years ago. His teacher
was Professor Tait. ""You don't play
golf with your muscles,"" Professor
Tait said to him one day; ""you play
with your morals."" ""But I hope,''
said Sir Oliver, with a hasty glance
round, ""that no one will consider my
morals as bad as my golf.""
Cardinal Logue, during a eountry
visit, was asked how many sermons a
preaeher could prepare in a week. Smil
ing, Cardinal Logue answered: ""If
the preacher is a man of extraordinary
ability, he can prepare one sermon; if
a man of average ability, two; if a
blockhead, ten or twelve.""

A FAIR EXCHANGE.
Large sums of money are no
dodbt realized from simple spec
ulation, but the great fortunes
are-derived from legitimate aud
honest business where the goods
furnished are worth the price
they bring. Certain famous busi
n333 men have accumulated then
millions wholly in this way.
Prompt and faithful in every
contract or engagement they en
jay the confidence of the public
and command a clas3 of trade
that is refused to unstable or
tricky competitors. In the long
run it does not pay to cheat or
deceive others. A humbug may
be advertised with a noise like
the blowing of a thousand trum
pets, but it is soon detected and
exposed. The manufacturers of

from the blood, and is effec

Know Your Smithsonian
By JERRY O’LEARY, JR.
Star Staff Writer
Editor’s note: The Smithsonian Institution is one ot the world's greatest treasure
houses of Man's study of the world in which he lives. This is the third in a series of
articles about Washington’s famous museum.
ONE whole hall at the National Museum
of the Smithsonian Institution Is de
voted to displaying the large mammals of
North America, and the collection Is more
complete than will ever be seen In any Zoo.
The animals are shown with dloramlc
backgrounds that seem to make them
breathe and be ready for Instant flight.
The groups show grizzly bears In what
is now Glacier Park, elk In Wyoming, black,
bears In Western Pennsylvania, large Al
askan moose with their palmated antlers.
Stone's caribou on the march In a stony
creek bed, mountain lions in Yellowstone
canyon, Alaskan wolves on the hunt In the
Far North, pronghorn antelope In a sage
brush-covered expanse In the Northwestern
States, a group of Virginia deer In a cypress
swamp, and Rocky Mountain sheep in an
area of snow-flecked mountains.
The largest group is that of a herd of
buffalo in the badlands of the Dakotas.
Expert taxidermists have done a superb
Job of presenting these beautiful creatures
as they looked In life. The solid parts of
the exhibit, such as the earth, stones and
trees, are imaginatively melded into painted
backgrounds that fade into the distance as
though the observer were looking at a gen
uine landscape
The conditions of terrain and weather
are accurately reproduced both for the
student and the untrained eyes of the ap
proximately 4 million people who visit the
museum every year.

fireball was found in Russia
last November.
The value of it—at least for
some types of meteorite studies
—is that it was found within a
few months after it dropped
from the skies, compared with
delays of several years or more
in the case of most other me
teorites. Dr. Arnold told report
ers at a meeting of the Amer
ican Geophysical Union.
The scientist said the Rus-
sians already have distributed!
between 4’ 2 and 7 pounds of
their windfall among labora
tories of the United States.
Dr. Arnold reported a rel
atively bountiful year in the
meteorite-discovery field. Three
have been found since last Oc
tober. Besides the one in Rus
sia, they are a 4’i pounder
found at Hamlet. Ind., and an
other discovered only recently
in Alberta. Canada, weighing
about 500 pounds.
Os the three, Russia's is the
rarer, iron type of meteor. The
others are stone meteors. 1

FULLY DESCRIBED
BY DR. 'JJL UDDER
(Special to The Herald
AUSTIN, Texas, Oct. 8 -Valuable
Information regarding the metcrorite
which fell in Troup, Texas, several
years age is contained in an article
by Dr. J. A. UdcSen, head of the eco
nomic geology division of tne Bu
reau of Economic Geology in the Uni
versity of Texas, recently published
in the • Proceedings of the United
States National Museum. There are
now pieces of this store in the Bureau
of Economic Geology of the Univer
sity one piece weighs 840 grams, an
other weighs 124 grams, and there
are a few smaller fragrant* weigh
ing two or three grams. About 20
meteorites hr.ve been found in Texas,
but the Troup stone is the most re
cent, The U rgest one was found
near Toyah about 12 years ago, and
weighed 1700 pounds. It was bought
by Chicago University. Dr. Udden
gives an interesting account of the
meteorite In his article, as follows:
‘This meteor was secured soon
after Its fall by Mr. T. M. Coupland
of TYoup, Texas, and by him donated j
to the University of Texas. It fell
close to a negro boy who was plough
ing in a field about three miles north
of Troup on the morning of April
2€, 1917, Tht boy heard the meteor
and ‘saw it smoking’ after it hit the
ground. He did not investigate the j
fall, but an older person. Forrest
Lawson, went to the place indicated
by the boy and found the meteor
about six inches below the surface of ;
the ground. It,was later during the j
day brought to Mr. (•oupland, *wh©
first identified it as a meteor In
a letter of the same data to Prof H.
Y. Benedict, of the University of
Texas, Dr. Coupland related the cir
cum: tam es of the observation of th*’
fall as given above and said that the
meteor weighed 2 pounds and 4 1-2
ounces; that it was black on the out
side. hut about the color of lime rock
after the surface was removed. It
also appears to hrve some flrkes of
bright metal scattered through.
A few ft*y* aiicr toe iuif r
Coupland addresr-ed a circular letter
t»» some people in Smith and arijace it
counties*. In this he inquired for
observations t»n the fall of the
meteorite and secured some informa
tion worth recording. At Nacogdo
ches sonic 47 miles southeast from
Troup, one man reported to have
seen the fall and two persons report
id having noted the sound it pro
duced- The noise the meteor made
was also heard at Big Sandy in Sul
phur county, about 30 miles north
from Troup, at Arp, in Smith county,
about seven mile* northwest from
Troup; and r.t a pump station located
about 17 miles southeast from the
same jioint. At Troup Mr. Coupland
states that many people heard an un
usual and intense noise on the morn
ing that the meteor fell. A weekly
newspaper, the Jacksonville Progress
made mention of the fall, from which

it has been inferred that the fall
was also herrd at this place, which
lies about 15 milts southwest from
Troup.
“In form this meteorite belongs to
(he giwtthoid or spliriter-Iike type
evidently having originally measured
somewhat more than 15 centimeters
in length, quadrangular in cross sec
tion, thinning in one diameter toward
one of its extremities and at the
-ame time turning somewhat abrupt
ly transversely to its longer axis,
near its smaller end. On one side j
of its heaviest end i« a blunt point, j
perhaps due to fusion on the for- ,
ward side of the stone it passed .
through the atmosphere.
“As already mentioned, the meteor !
quadrangular in cross section, hav
ing four flat sides of about equal
width. It r.eenis likely that the apex !
was the the forward point of the me- (
teor as it fell. If such was the case, j
the edge nearest this apex would
cleave the air as the meteor advanced, j
It is quite clear that the impinge- j
ment of the air currents producing j
the pits on the sides was not the i
same on the two posterior faces of
the meteor as that on the anterior
faces.
*• Its texture is fine grained- It
is chondritic, showing smalMight
grains of an oval outline on a pol

scattered many small particles of
iron, small particle^ of plnohotite, |

History, so Important, for It contains specimens
of 603 out of a possible 677 known meteorite
""falls"" or -finds"" In -all parts of the world.
The untimely death of Professor Ward, who
was killed by an automobile at Buffalo on July
5, has called renewed attention to bis splendid
collection, far and away the most valuable !n
America and the largest private collection In
the world. Professor Ward's enthusiasm and
prodigal expenditure of energy and money
placed him head and shoulders above his rival
collectors. Part of his success in making the
collection so nearly complete came from ex
changing valuable duplicates for specimens which
he needed, but which money could not dislodge,
in other collections.
Meteorites are named after the place in which
they fall or are found. A meteorite on meeting
the earth's atmosphere becomes heated to such
an extent by friction that disruption takes place*
Consequently parts of the same ""fall** or ••find**
are on exhibition at different museums, and the
aim of the collector is to have all known falls
or finds represented In his cabinets. The WaN
collection, which is valued at $100,000; haa rep
resentations of 95 per cent of all the known
meteorites of Australia, Asia, Africa »nd South
America. 99 per cent of those of North America
and 97 per cent of those of Europe. Tbirty oX
th« -i -dmens— there are sixteen hundred In all
mn the largest single pieces known In their
reepecUve falls. The total weight of the collec

they had no such intention and blame the archi

They are easy to recognize, when one knows
what to look for. Most meteorites are one of
two kinds: Iron meteorites or stony meteorites.
The ""Irons"" are always black on the outside,
when newly fallen; but when one has lain ex
posed to the air for a time, it will probably he
reddish-brown with rust. In either case, of
course, it will be very heavy. Often, but not
always, it will have peculiar pits in It. somewhat
like a piece of putty Into which somebody has
pushed his thumbs and fingers. Any strange
pseco of Iron, which Isn’t clearly of some other
origin, may possibly be a meteorite.
Stony meteorites are a bit harder to Identify.
They, too. are always heavier than the average
earth stone; and also they are always black on

ever, they differ greatly from Iron meteorite*

looks very much like a piece of grayish # bite

If It Is an old fall, of black paint mixed with

Stony meteorites are also often pitted, but the
pits are seldom as shandy defined as they are

good deal like the crust of a loaf of cracked*

over It. These flakes may also be seen while the

To see a meteorite actually crash to earth Is
one of the most spectacular aights among nat
ural phenomena. One vivid description of a fall
some years ago tells us that the noise was like
""heavy cannonading, accompanied by an unearth
ly hissing.** and that the ground trembled as In
an earthquake. People rushed from their houses
In fright, and though It was midaftemnon, they
saw a great ""dazzling"" hall of fire In the heav
ens. ""like to the moon In size, sputtering and
throwing off a long train of spark*."" and louring
In Its wake ""a heavy line of black smoke."" Tills
meteorite fell In more than a thousand frag
roents near Forest City, lowa. One piece, weigh
ing 00 pounds, fell near a farmer In a field and
hurled Itself more than three feet In the hard
prairie soil.
Hardly a year passes without a fall soniew here
In the United States, witnessed by persons who
testify to Its splendor and frightening aspect.
Fortunately, however, we have never been vis
ited by a meteorite such as fell on the isolated
*tepj«es of north-central Siberia In 11X1$. The
force of the air, blasting out from It, mowed
flat more than seven hundred square miles of
dense lorrst. It killed a herd of 1„700 reindeer,
and forced a train. +""«» miles south, to stop In
order to keep on the rails. A Itusslan farmer,
50 miles away, was knocked unconscious and re
turned to hi* senses to find the air so hot that
he feared hi* clothes would catch fire. His house
was demolished.
This great mass of Iron, buried deep in the
ground, is estimated to weigh 40.000 tons; hut
it Is small Indeed when compared to another
mass that fell on the desert plains near Win
slow. Ariz.. In a time before the white men came
there. This enormous meteorite, which bored its
way more than 1,-700 feet Into the earth, is
known to weigh several million tons. It left
behind It a crater almost one mile across and
nearly 000 feet deep, as it appears today.
Many other tremendous falls have happened
since the world began. No doubt. If we were to
explore the bottoms of the oceans, we would
find hundreds of great masses of stone and Iron
buried in the slime. Other great masses are
buried beneath our feet, and the craters which

they left behind them hare been obliterated by
wind and rain. It ha# been discovered very re
cently. however, that traces of these craters may

airplane Several groups of them hav» been

Where do meteorites come from? It Is sup
posed that they are fragments of comets which
have been torn apart by the powerful gravita
tion of the sun and the larger planet# of the
solar system. The Leonids are believed to he
fragment# of Temple's comet, which has disap
peared like the meteor showers. Another comet,
known a# Biela'a. was actually seen to break up
and Anally to vanish entirely; hut now we are
showered with an unusually large number of
meteors whenever It should be In the neighbor
hood of our earth, according to the computations !
of astronomers.
How many meteorites have really hit the
earth? Professor N'lnlnger estimates that more
titan 87.(**) «.f them have fallen on every square
mile of the earth's surface tines the mammoth
roamed the steaming forests of prehistoric times.
That means that the very ground on which we
walk is made tip largely of the dust Into which
they have fallen.
Confirmation of that belief |# seen In the the
nry advanced recently by Ilaipb W. Stone, as
sistant state geologist of Pennsylvania, that a
coating of meteorite dust 19 Indies thick lies on
the surface of the earth. This coating Is an
accumulation of oo.«##>.OUC years or more, he
says, and Is constantly being Increased, although
at such a slow rats that It la not noticeable.
Out of 47U meteorite falls since meteorite# be
came known and accredited. 125 years ago, 130,-
UMi Individual meteorite# have Ikssi recovered,
or an average of 277 a fall. This figure supplies
one meteoric stone for each 4*o square miles of
land surface of the globe In a century and a
quarter.
Most of the falls were observed In areas of
comparatively dense population and where sur
face conditions were favorable for observation
of the landing and for recovery.
•if we consider the 287 witnessed falls in Eu
r>>j«*an countries. Itussia. India. Japan and the
Unite*] States, amounting to 129,349 Individual
meteorites or 450 stones a fall In a combined
area of 7.250,000 square miles, we have one me
teorite for every 5.7 V 4 miles,"" Mr. Stone says.
""During the 12.7 years only two falls from
which stones were recovered were observed In
the whole western third of the United States,
apparently due to spare population and the
nature of the terrain. Although practically all
observed falls from which stones are recovered
occurred In daytime, there is no reason for as
suming that falls are not Just as frequent at
night
""On these assumptions. It is conservative to
estimate that In these twelve countries at least
ten tiroes a* many meteorites fell as were recov
ered. or one to each five and a half square
miles.""
If the rate of fall of the last century has
been constant, according to the assistant state
geologist, each square mile of surface has re
ceived 727 meteoric units. In the G0.0U0.000 years
since the beginning of tertiary times, on this
basis of computation, the earth received 87,240
meteorites a square mile.
•'The weight of the 129.349 stones recovered,”
he continued, “was 17.074 pounds. This is a very
low average, since the larger stones usually bury
themselves, but this figure gives about two
ounces a stone.
""This would mean a flve-ton-a-square-mlle
average for the entire earth. In the last 125
years.
""Should we continue the computation for long
er periods we get Into ponderable figures. Then,
If we figure not from the beginning of the ter
tiary time but from early Paleozlc time, 000.-
000.OU0 rather than 00,000,000 years ago, we get a
weight of material which certainly would make
the earth wabble on Its axis If concentrated In
one spot on the surface.""
Besides the meteorites which land, about a
million an hour daily are consumed in our at
mosphere before striking the earth, Mr. Stone
estimates.
“Considering five pounds the average weight
of these, that would mean 50,000 tons of mete
oric dust sifting down daily. Distributed over
the globe, however, the result would be a layer
one millimeter thick In 10.000 years, or a blanket
19 feet deep In 00,000,000 years.""

in South Viet Nam’s war
against Communist rebels.
Some high officials here feel I'
the proposals—both military 1
and economic—could be one of
the most important factors in j
whether this threatened na- I
tion survives in the critical ’
months ahead. i:
It would call for a consider- '
ably larger outlay of American
aid. Informed sources indicated. 1
The American team, headed J
by Dr. Eugene Staley of the

spent three weeks here working
with Vietnamese experts. Their '
joint report is still secret.
Informed quarters said the '
goal is an all-out military and

■ Pessimistic en Neutral Rule
The United States also is
i pessimistic about prospects for
. forming a truly neutral “gov
. ernment of national union.”
f Prince Souvanna Phouma. the
Communist-backed neutral
. leader, is regarded as the most
‘ likely choice of the Laotian
’ King to become Premier.
Theoretically, his plan to
’ make himself the center of a
three-bloc, “troika” cabinet is
a laudable concept, officials say.
. It would bring together a large
group of neutralists surrounding
Prince Souvanna Phouma as
. the “center horse” of the
troika, with a minimum num
, ber of pro-Communist Pathet
’ Lao and rightist ministers
flanking him.
The big difficulty, from the
American point of view, is the
J center group. Those designated
- as neutrals are regarded in
Washington as pro-Communist
' or at least willing to work
1 closely with the Communists.
Deputy Premier Phoui Nosa
van and other members of the
s rightist Royal Laotian Govem
; ment are expected to oppose
: this formula vigorously.

Maj. Yuri Gagarin, Russia’s 27-year-old astronaut, stands in open car
outside the Russian Embassy in London and responds to cheers as he
left t<\ return to the Soviet Union today.—AP Wirephoto via radio from
London.
Gagarin Is Given
Cheering Sendoff
LONDON, July 15 (AP).—A
cheering crowd gave Maj. Yuri
Gagarin a happy sendoff to
Moscow today. A five-day visit
had brought the Soviet space
man plaudits normally reserved
for heads of state and movie
stars.
The smiling cosmonaut, 27,
told an airport news confer
ence:
“I carry back with me the
most warm memories of the
friendly reception given me
and of the hospitality in Great
Britain. . . May the friendship
between the Soviet Union and
the people of Great Britain de
velop and grow storng.”
A crowd of about 2,000 milled
around the Soviet Embassy an
hour earlier as Maj. Gagarin
left for the airport. Many were
jostled into the Embassy gar
dens, damaging shrubbery and
flowers, and a dozen policemen
had to shoulder away through
for the little Russian to reach
his car.
Maj. Gagarin stood up in an
open gray Rolls-Royce en route
to the airport, waving and
smiling as the crowds in the
streets recognized and cheered
him. eavy traffic lengthened
the trip 13 minutes beyond
schedule.

Birch Society Blasted
As Fascist by Senator
By the Associated Press
Senator Stephen M. Young,
Democrat of Ohio, says only
a lack of rifles and military
organization separates the John
Birch Society and its leader,
Robert Welch, from naziism.
In a Senate speech yesterday,
Senator Young described the
militantly conservative group
as Fascist and Mr. Welch as
“a little dictator” and a “char
latan of the far right.”
Senator Young said Mr.
Welch, after being defeated for
the Republican nomination for
Lieutenant Governor of Massa
chusetts, “turned against the
political process itself and our
form of Government.”
Senator Young said Mr.
Welch “hopes to weld the
antis—the spreaders of racial
hate, the bully boys and the
lunatic fringe everywhere into
a political movement for pow
er.” He added:
“These radicals of the right
in many communities have been
practicing character assassina
tion without regard for the
truth, threatening merchants
with boycotts, threatening col-
lege professors and school prin
cipals with dismissal. They
spread fear, hatred and sus
picion.”
The Birch Society, Senator
Young said, is the organization
“doing the most to undermine
national unity” and its leaders
are “unwittingly acting as the
handmaidens of the Soviet
Union.”

625-Pound Meteorite
A 625-pouad stony meteorite,
believed to be the most recent
“big find” in the United States,
has been acquired by the Smith
sonian Institution for scientific
study and public display.
The object, largest meteorite
of its type in the Institution’s
collection of more than 1,000,
was discovered last spring by
a New Mexico farmer while he
was plowing.
Associate Curator E. P. Hen
derson said the meteorite was
purchased in mid-June. He said
it apparently had been lying
dormant for centuries on the
New Mexico farm.
It was discovered southeast
of Clovis, a New Mexico city
near the Texas border, when
the farmer broke his plow
against it.
He wrote to the institution,
Mr. Henderson said, and later
sent a sample.
Mr. Henderson said he cut
a thin section bf the sample
and “could see it had the char
acteristic structure of a meteo
rite.”
After the curator visited the
Stiffer Tax Asked
On Lending Firms
By th* Associated Press
The Treasury Department
says mutual savings banks and
savings and loan associations no
longer need preferential tax
treatment.
Secretary of the Treasury
Dillon yesterday asked the
House Ways and Means Com
mittee to impose stiffer taxes
on these organizations.
Mr. Dillon said the lending
agencies are virtually tax ex
empt because of special tax
privileges granted in the early
stages of their development.
Now, he said, their assets total
8110 billion and annual earn
ings are over $750 million, while
total taxes in 1958 were only
SB.B million.
C. Elwood Knapp, president
of the United States Savings
and Loan League, said higher
taxes ultimately would mean a
reduction of $5 to $6 billion in
funds available for home loans.
THE EVENING STAR
Washington, D. C.
Saturlay, July 15, 1961
site and inspected the meteorite
which had been moved to a
bam, negotiations started for
its purchase.
“The farmer thought he
owned the thing,” Mr. Hender
son said, “but courts have held
that the meteorite belongs to
the person who owns the land
on which it was found.”
It was discovered on rented
land. Mr. Henderson said the
farmer purchased it from his
landlord and then sold it to
the institution.
The 20-inch-high meteorite
is an Irregular spherical mass,
Mr. Hendersadn said. It is
known' scientifically as a chon
drite, “made essentially of stone
from another sizable body.”
While it is not the largest
stony meteorite discovered
(there is a larger one at the
University of New Mexico),
it is the largest held by the
institution.
Fell Long Ago
“It is obviously an old fall,”
the curator said. “It had been
in the ground so long that
some of the red sediment of
recent formations there had
more of less attached Itself
to the meteorite.”
He said the “dome” of the
meteorite, the leading edge of
the object during its flight
earthward, was “very conspic
uous,” and that the object
may have broken into several
pieces.
Scientific study will deter
mine if the meteorite is re
lated to other stony meteorites
which have been found near
Clovis.
The object is one of about
100 meteorites the institution
is displaying in its recently
opened meteorite alcove at
Tenth and Constitution N.W.
Included in the display is a
map showing all the meteoritic
finds in the United States.

Three Cialmanti
A valuable meteorite fell on a cer­
tain farm and the landlord at once'
claimed it. ""All mineral and metals
on the land belong to me,"" he said.
""That Is the lease.""
But the tenant disagreed with him.
""This meteorite,"" he said, ""wasn't on
the farm when the lease was drawn
up.""
The landlord perceived the Justice
of that claim, He thought a moment.
Then he said, decisively: ""I claim her
as flying game.""
But the tenant was ready for him.
""She's got neither wings nor feathers,""
he said,.. ""Therefore} as ground game,
she's mine.""
And so they continued their axgu
ment. Meanwhile* a revenue officer,
arriving With a wagon^ proceeded to
put the meteorite in his vehicle, ""I
claim her for the government,"" he,
said, ""as an article introduces into the
country without payment of duty^'

man, a witness, was roaring out his
testimony,.
""Stop!"" the judge commanded.
""Don't you know you're in court?""
""Ya'as'r"" replied the negro.
""Well, don't you know what a court
is?"" '•.•••'
""Oh, ya'as'r,"" said the old fellow
with a bow, ""ya'as'r a co't is a place

' According to the Census Bu
reau, the sheep industry has not
shown any ma(erial,change since
the last census in 1900. Exclud
ing lambs, because of the differ
ence in the time of year when the
census was taken, it is shown
that there were 39,470,312 wool
producing sheep in 1910, as com
pared with 39,852,967 for 1900.
Corrected figures are expected
to show an actual decease of
about 1 per cent from 1900.
Taking the returns by geograph
ical divisions, there was a de
crease of about 1,000,000 sheep
in the North Atlantic division, in
the South Atlantic division there
was a decease of about 154,000,
and in the South Central division
the decrease was about lbH,000.
In the North Central division
there was scarcely any change,
10,009,451 being reported in 1910.
or only some 14,000 more' than in
1900. The Western division
showed an increase of about
1,000,000 sheep.

House Struck by Meteorite.
Sweeping down out of the sky with
a sharp hiss, a small meteorite
crashed against the blind on the
house of Alfred H. Rickards, near
Wakefield, Mass., and set the house
on fire. The village hosemen were
called out, and no serious damage was
done. The meteorite glanced off from
the house to the ground. It weighs
about five pounds and is almost per
fectly round.

About That Mosquero Bunch
Some of the Roy District Fair
officers who visited that would be
town, that boats of county seat
honors, predict a rather gloomy
future for that layout. . Mosquero
always has had the faculty of be
ing a backward proposition
There was never anything gotten
up by other towns on this mesa
that Mosquero did' not do some
thing to discourage the fiuod will
of its few and enthusiastic
farmers.
The Roy District Fair was got
ten up with a view of showing
what this mesa can do, and the
Fair is not only for the benefit of
the Royites, but all the people
contiguous to Roy, the best and
largest town on the mesa. What
is there at Mosquero? Go to
Mosquero and find out for your
self. You will find a town and
community run by a certain in
dividual, and who is he? To the
better element of Mcquero the
Koy District Fair extends a wel
come and assurance of fair treat
ment. Aside from lawlessness, you
never hear much of that one
man's town.
List your property with the

Work as a Panacea.
I consider work one of the greatest
blessings. I am not sure but that It Is
the greatest blessing, says Erman J.
RIdgway in the Delineator. I must
think it is, for I recall now that I
wrote four injunctions in my boy's
birth book, and work heads the list.
Work keeps the body healthy, the
mind steady. When the heart Is sick
work. When hope Is dim work.
After failures, get up and work. Go
at obstacles on the run. Tackle Im
possibilities hard. Measure today by
last year, five years ago. If gaining,
fine; work. If losing, too bad! work
harder. Be glad that you have work to
do. And If you haven't any definite
work, find It quick and get at It. It
you have done your work and earned
leisure, and are not worn out, don't
rust out."" Trvel; study; go In for
community work; lend a hand; help
somebody somewhere, somehow. That
Is living.
Beet Pulp.
Beet pulp can be preserved In siloa,
but undergoes considerable loss In
value under the process. Freight bills
are also heavy in transporting the ma
terial from the sugar mlils, and It Is
probable that purchases of dried pulp
would be more profitable. By soaking
In water it can be made a fair substi-

Have You Tried It?
There is a bottle of Gardui waiting for you at the
drug store. Have you tried it?
If not, we urge you to do so, before your troubles
have obtained such a hold on you, that nothing will drive
them out
Even now, it may be nearly too late. But try it any
how. . If anything can help you, Cardui will. It has helped
in thousands of cases, where other medicines had been
tried in vain. Why should it not do the same for you?

Not a Musical Horse.
When a boy gets hold of a mouth
organ there's no telling what will hap
pen. One in Detroit was going along
the street the other day, playing ""The
Girl I Left Behind Me,"" and playing It
flr -class, too, when a horse reared
up and fell dead. He had been used
to hearing the piano playing at home,
and when real music struck his ear It
went right to his heart and keeled him
over.

TIIUUSDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1919.
ARMISTICE DAY
ITHOUT FACTIONAL dispute or difference the veter
ans of Bridgeport are
celebration which will be worthy of the occasion it celebrates.
The thought originated in Raymond Y. Harris Post, and re
ceived the suport of soldi ""rs and their organization throughout
the city, the approval of the city government and the approba
tion of the citizens.
The parade is to be a notable feature of the celebration, and
it is desired, and strongly requested, that every outfit in
Bridgeport shall appear.
No organization will even think of refusing the invitation.
It comes from those who marched often in perilous times, to
those who had not the privilege of joining in the direct service
of war. It will be a pleasure and a privilege to respond.
Armistice Day is destined to become a festival of the world,
a Fourth of July for mankind, a planetary celebration which in
Its due season will encircle the globe with manifestations of
satisfaction over a world set free.
A BILL TOO
T
HERE ARE certain maladies, commonly called the social
diseases, which have been exploited bv venders of
quack remedies, with some injury to the young and inexper
ienced. A bill in congress forbids the transmission through the
mails of literature relating to such quack remedies. To this
extent the measure is excellent. It continues, however, to forbid
medicines and treatments which are innocent and useful, and
to this extent House Bill 5123 is not a good bill. It should not
be passed until it is narrowed to cover the precise evil of quack
""emedies and social maladies.

PROTECTIVE ASSOCIATION TAG DAY.
BRIDGEPORT IS an industrial city in which, young women
are employed almost as numerously as young men.. To
this city from other communities come girls and women seeking
employment, sometimes with scanty funds, and often without
knowing where shelter is to be found.
For many years Bridgeport had no organization distinc
tively devoted to the immediate reception and care 01 sucTi
visitors. There was abundant opportunity for the temporary
care and shelter of men, but -almost none for women.
Bridgeport Protective Association was organized especial
ly to fill this void, to provide immediately for any woman or

SUPPOSED TO BE
FROM BRIDGEPORT
Thomas W. Condon, 3S, an alleg
ed highwayman, who gives his address
as 765 Howard avenue, Bridgeport,
was arrested yesterday afternoon in
Xewark, X. J., after a thrilling chase
through the streets of that c'ty.
The pursuit started after Condon
had been foiled in an attempt to
hold up the manager and cashier of
the Western Electric Co.'s tool mak
ing shop. The fugitive attempted
to commandeer an automobile to
make his escape, but the driver of
the machine frustrated his plans.
Condon, according to liip- police,
was born in Bridgeport, and in
1914 conducted a private detective
agency in this city. The local police
have no record of the man, but it is
believed that he was formerly employ
ed at the Remington Arms Co.'s
plant.
In his rooms the police found a
set of false whiskers and a newspa
per clipping telling of the escape of
Prank Williams from the Ansonia
jail. Condon stated that he knows
the officer whom Williams eluded, and
a friend sent him the clipping.

After Meteorite's Metals.
This search has both a commercial
and a scientific purpose. It is pro
posed to utilize the metal of which
the meteorite is undoubtedly com
posed. In this respect the attempt of
Mr. Patton and Prof. Nicholas re
sembles that of D. M. Barringer of
Philadelphia to discover the great
meteorite, known as the Canyon Dia
tolo Meteorite, which made the re
markable depression called! .by scien
tists Meteorite Crater in central
Arizonia.
This phenomenon, familiar to non
scientific natives of the place as Coon
Butte, measures ' a mile across and.
has a depth of six or seven hundred
feet.
A great number of fragments, vary
ing in size from that of a pebble the
size of one's finger tip to masses
weighing half a ton, have been found,
but the gigantic author of the crater
is as yet undiscovered.
A number of these specimens of
the Canyon Diablo Meteorite, the lar
gest weighing 1,100 pounds, are on
exhibition at the Museum of Natural
History.
Part Nlckle; Part Iron.
These samples are of solid nickel
iron, 10 per cent, nickel, 90 per cent, stolen $63 from a Fairfield man, Sat
iron. It is sutioosed that the Utah urday niKht. were bound over to the
meteorite, which the Baltimore expe-
dition seeks, is composed of these
same substances in the same or slight
ly different proportions.
In the opinion of Dr. Hovey Its dis
covery would be of no practical com
mercial value, since it is impossible
to blast or in any way break apart
such a tough compound, and if, as
Mr. Patton supposes, the meteorite
weighs 5,000 tons it would be equally
impossible to remove It.
""We had enough trouble with the
Ahnlghito, which only weighs thirty
six and a half tons,"" says Dr. Hovey.
This stone was brought by Com
mander Robert E. Peary from Mel
ville Bay, Greenland, In 1897 after
two unsuccessful attempts to move
It.
That Mr. Patton is not of the
opinion expressed by Dr. Hovey is
evident from his having some time

the meteorite is supposed to have
fallen for the purpose of reserving
it for research by the Maryland

LING A
Boston, Oct. 16. Before large
audiences at Bridgewater and Mid
dleboro, Richard H. Long, Dem
ocratic candidate for Governor,
who flayed Massachusetts corpora
tions in general and the Edison com
pany, the New England Telephone
and Telegraph Company and the Bos
ton Elevated Railway company in
particular.
He declared that these companies
were fighting him tooth and nail, and
that they were striving to prevent his
election mainly because he stands for
the graduated income tax. ""The grad
uated income tax would give the State
an annual income of between $50,
000,000 and S75.000.000,"" he declared,
""and a large portion of it would come
from these corporations who are op
posed to my election.""
Mr. Long accused the New England
Telephone & Telegraph Company of
buying up the State Legislature;
charged the Edison company with
making over $1,000,000 a year profit
from waterpower for which it paid
only $75,000 a year, and claimed that
the 10-cent fares are the result of
""gross mismanagement on the part
of the Elevated officials.""
Mr. Long also declared that tne
Bay State Street Railway Company,
spent over a half million dollars in
fees paid to friends of Governor
Coolidge during the investigation of
the road, and that Lieutenant-Governor
Channing Cox received $3,000
of th:s s-um for acting as an auc
tioneer for the company.
He laid great stress on the grad
uated income tax, and outlined his
plan, which calls for a tax of 3 per
1 unaer government ownership and at a:
art voca red
! nve-cent tare.
: paying the returned soldiers an ad-
ditional bonus of $360.
Mr. Long then declared that Cover
nor sjooncige was not waging a cam-
paign ""simply because he is afraid to
face the charges made against him.""

Since 1914 the Association has been doing this work wei
and completely. It provides temporary shelter and food, care
while seeking work or waiting pay and training and advice
while at the House. It gives help in obtaining work, assistance
in straightening out family differences, medical treatment
through physicians and proper authorities and procures free
legal advice where it is needed.
It is furnishing 1.000 meals a month to those for the time
being in need.
This work is not costly, but it demands funds, which will
be in part obtained through the generosity of the people, which
they will have an opportunity to show on Saturday, which,
will be Tag Day for the Bridgeport Protective Association.
The natural sympathy for womanhood, and the common
understanding of the difficulties that beset the path of the toil
ing woman, makes certain a generous response.

KIRBY AND Miller of airplane 44, are dead at Castle Rock,

As predicted by some of our weather prophets, it seems that
they have had a genuine snow storm up in Berkshire county

told you so.
Now is the time for frost-fishing. Quite a number of men
and boys can be seen any of these cool nights in different locali

should say that they were reasonably successful from what we
have seen of their luck.
The veterans of the Twelfth Regiment had a very pleasant

GIANT METEORS
SELDOM CAUSE
LOSS TO MAN
Largest Found Weighs 70
Tons; Fall in Siberia
Kills Reindeer.
By Science Sa ><■<:
WASHINGTON. Man h 29—The
seventy-ton meteor reported from
South Africa i; the world's larges*
actually discovered, but It is prob
ably dwarfed by the one which
many years ago caused the famous
Meteor Crater in Arizona. This is
the opinion of Dr. George P. Merrill,
famous meteor expert of the United
States National Museum here.
The great meteor which fell In the
Yenissei Province of Siberia on
June 30, 1908, was also probably
much larger, but as yet the main
part oi neither of these has been lo
cated. Another huge crater, due to
a meteor that rell some time in the
past, was discovered in the Pamir, in
central Asia, near Afghanistan. This
latter crater is a conical pit 260 feet
in diameter and 33 feet deep.
The 1908 Siberian meteor is prob
ably the largest that has ever struck ,
the earth. The region of the fall is
over a mile in diameter in a marshy
region. The ground is pitted with
deep funnels from 50 to 100 feet in
diameter, so that probably the;
meteorite, with a weight estimated 1
at half a million tons, burst to
pieces, bombarding the earth with •
fragments.
At the towns of Kerensk and;
Tlimsk, 250 miles away, great deto
nations were heard and pillars oi
smoke and lire were seen. Rail- j
road officials at Kansk, 400 miles j
distant, felt the air wave and heard j
a roaring sound, while the seismo- |
graph at Irkutsk, 900 miles aw’ay, j
detected the vibration of the earth ,
when it hit.
Though no human beings hap
pened to be in its path, one herd
of 1,500 reindeer belonging to a
farmer was annihilated. Only a
few scorched carcasses remained, i
Houses were badly damaged, and j
metal utensils were melted. Trees
on surrounding hills were scorched
and knocked over, where they can
still be seen with their tops point
ing away from the center. An ex
pedition : ent out by the Soviet gov
ernment ' tudied the general char
acter oi the region. Later borings
will be made for pieces of the actual
meteorite.
This a the first authenticated
time that a meteorite did damage
to man or animals.* It is fortunate
that it fell in such a sparsely set
tled region, and not in a large city,
like New York or London.
The South African meteor is re
ported to h • - been found at Otji
haene, near the head of the Groot- ;
fontein railway, in the northeast
ern part cl southwest Africa. Im
bedded in sott limestone its approxi
mate s>ze is 10x10x4 feet.

revive the rule which formerly existed at the English
court against the admission of divorcees, even had he
wished to do so. But it is doubtful whether he ever
contemplated anything of the kind. He is, above
everything else, a broad-minded man of the world,
inclined to be indulgent toward the failings of
others.
During his mother's reign he had on several occa
sions manifested indignation at the heartlessness
and harshness of some of the judgments of society,
and was not altogether displeased at the opportunity
afforded him as sovereign to foster the development
of that particular virtue, without the j>os«;ession of
which there is, according to the Founder of the
Christian religion, no salvation — namely, the virtue
of charity. It is to this that may be ascribed the
virtual removal of the former barrier against di
vorcees at his court. At the last state ball given at
Buckingham Palace I counted nearly a score of
women, no less than eight of them of American birth,
whose domestic infelicities had engaged the atten
tion of the tribunals of divorce In fact. King
Edward has taken the ground that, provided there
are no scandalous circumstances in connection with
divorces, the latter need no longer be regarded as a
bar to presentation at his court.
At Berlin, at St Petersburg, nay, even at Vienna,
a similar course lias been adopted, the Austrian
court merely stipulating that the legal dissolution
of the marriage in the case of Catholics should be
accompanied by a decree of the church annulling the
union. It may be added that the most influential
grand dame at the court of Berlin, namely the
Princess Biilow, wife of the Chancellor of the Ger
man Empire, and Countess Tassilo Festetics of
Tolna, Dame dv Palais at Vienna, and wife of the
Magyar nobleman who is Grand Master of Emperor
Francis Joseph's Hungarian household, ami Guard
ian of the Crown of Saint Stephen, are each of them
divorcees. Princess Billow is a stepdaughter of the
former Italian statesman and premier Minghetti. the
real author of Italy's participation in the Triple Al

sian envoy at ihe Court of Saxony. Among the sec-
FROM
W~WEN it was recently announced that a
twenty-ton meteorite had been presented
to the American Museum of Natural His
tor\ in New York, no one doubted the fact. Mrs.
William E. Dodge bought this huge mass of ore,
which was discovered near the Cascade range of
mountains in Oregon in 1002. She paid twenty
thousand six hundred dollars, the highest price ever
given for a meteorite, and bestowed it upon the
museum in memory of her husband. Onl\ one
other meteorite in the United States is larger, and
that is the one brought from the far north by Ex
plorer Peary in 1895, and it is now at the same
museum.
'llie advance of learning in the past century
could hardly be better illustrated than by the mat
ter-of-fact manner in which the news of this gift
was announced and received. The attitude, even
of scientific men. a hundred years ago toward ac
counts of meteorites was that of scorn and incredu
lity. Such expressions greeted the report of a
shower of stones at Juillac, France, in July, 1700.
The account was prepared witii great care by the
officers of the municipality. And yet Berthelon,
eminent for his learning, characterized it as ""a re
cital, evidently false, of a phenomenon physically
impossible and calculated to excite the pity, not
only of physicists, but of all reasonable people.""
Many meteorites were thrown away in those times
because the directors of museums were ashamed to
exhibit stones reputed to 'nave fallen from the
sky.
Discredited Falls of Stone
PRESIDENT JEFFERSON was told, in ISO 7. that
r Professors Silliman and Kingsley had described a
shower of stones at Weston, Connecticut. He re
marked: 'It is easier to believe that two Yankee
professors will lie than to believe that stones will
fall from heaven.""
The opinion of intelligent men. especially sci
entists, was undergoing a change, however, at that
time. This was due largely to the investigation by
the French Academy of the shower of meteorites
at Laigle in 1803. The inquiry established so
absolutely the fact that the stones had fallen from
outer space that scientific men were compelled by
logic to believe that such showers could occur else
where. And since the fall at Laigle, when two to
three thousand stones descended, no less than eleven
such showers have been recorded. In the shower
of l'ultusk, Poland, in 1868, one hundred thousand
stones are estimated to have fallen, the total weight
reaching over four hundred pounds. In a shower
at Mocs, Germany, in 1882, more than three thou
sand stones fell.
In the Unifd States, about seven hundred ami
fifty poun Is of meteoric matter descended ai Esther
ville, C.c. rgia, in IS7O. Several thousand stones
fell over ;.n area nine miles in length and one mile
wide near \>rest City, lowa, in 1890. These show
ers were marked by extraordinary phenomena of
light and - und, making them events never to be

them. And such showers thus far have been
strangely free from fatalities.
In ancient times when nearly everyone was super
stitious, there was less skepticism about meteorites
than a hundred years ago, when scientists insisted
upon seeing with their own eyes bef< re believing.
The people of antiquity thought the fiery visitors
from other worlds nu -sengers from the god<. Tem
ples were built for them, they were decorated and
worshiped as divine, and coins and medals were
struck in their honor. Thus the omphalos of IMt hi
is represented on coins of sixty-five towns, and one
collection in the American Museum of New York
contains sixty coins representing nineteen deities
and thirty-seven towns. The early Greeks called
them H.etylus, doubtless meaning the home of God.
Solving the Mystery
■^f -LIOXS of meteors have shoi across the sky.
* but it was not until modern times that man at
tempted to solve the mystery as to the actual nature
of the falling stars. <>n any pleasant night when the
moon is absent the meteorite may be seen. A -tar
appears t<> dart from its niche, and with fiery train
dashes athwart the sky. Sometimes it is in a
straight line, again curved. Sometimes it explodes
and affects strange shapes, and they come from any
and all points, and constitute, whether singly or in
showers, one of the most striking and beautiful of
all natural phenomena.
The modern astronomer was the first to make
collections and study them, and as a result there
are several large accumulations in the world. The
largest is the meteorite collection in the Natural
History Museum in Vienna. Representativi
five hundred showers are there. That of Pr.
Ward in the American Museum contains six hundred
and three distinct meteorites, two hundred .aid
forty-one siderites, twenty-eight siderolites, and
three hundred and thirty-four eolites; two hundred
and twenty-nine of which were from Xorth America,
two hundred and thirteen from Europe. th<
mainder from all over the world. The total collec
tion weighs fifty-five hundred pounds.
An analysis of these show that thej do nor ■
rially differ from the earth, and their presei
explained by assuming that in the dim pasi
worlds, planets, or suns have crashed together, and
the surviving wreckage distributed through
in showers of metal and stone ranging in size
atoms to pieces as large a- a house. Thai -
collision is possible is suggested by the suddei
pearance ol brilliant stars where previously nothing
had been seen, suggestive of some vast conflagration
in space, due to the collision or contact of mighty
bodies. Such may have been Tychos, a star which
suddenly appeared in 1572, became as brig
Venus and disappeared in fifteen months; or Xova

of the reigning houses of Europe, yet there is only
one instance, at any rate in modern times, of a di
vorcee being admitted to share a throne. The
throne was that of Austria, and the Princess in ques
tion was the Empress Caroline. A daughter of the
first King of Bavaria, she was married when barely
sixteen to King William I. of Wurtemberg. After
six years of marriage the couple were divorced, and
two'years later, thanks to a papal dispensation, she
became the fourth wife of Francis I. of Austria,
father-in-law of the first Napoleon, and last bearer
of the title of ""Emperor of the Holy Roman Em
pire.""
While there are some who will be disposed to
argue that the courts of Europe, in removing the
barriers which from the third until the eighth decade
of the nineteenth century were maintained against
the admission of divorcees, have merely kept abreast
of the trend of popular sentiment, and have been
compelled against their will to recede from a position
which they were unable any longer to maintain,
there are others who will urge that the relaxation
of the rule laid down by Queen Victoria at the
beginning of her reign, and adopted by nearly all the
other sovereigns of Europe, is responsible for the
alarming increase of divorce. They hold that it has
become a menace to our entire social system, since
it tends to destroy the family sentiment upon which
the family may be said to be based. Certain it is
that the barring of divorcees from court, rigorously
applied, acted as a powerful deterrent to the dissolu
tion of marriage ties, influencing as it did the attitude,
not merely of society, but of the people at large on
both sides of the Atlantic toward the question of
divorce.
Experience has shown that the church has become
powerless to check the evil. The law is equally
helpless and at fault in the matter. The only re
striction that can be devised must be of a social char
acter. in the nature of the old-time social ostracism,
and it is hopeless to dream of reviving this, as long
as divorcees continue to be welcomed with gracious
ness and distinction by royalty at the courts of
Europe.

impossible and calculated to excite the pity, not
only of physicists, but of all reasonable people.""
Many meteorites were thrown away in those times
because the directors of museums were ashamed to
exhibit stones reputed to have fallen from the
sky.
Discredited Falls of Stone
PRESIDENT JEFFERSON was told, in 1807, that
Professors Silliman and Kingsley had described a
shower of stones at Weston, Connecticut. He re
marked: ""It is easier to believe that two Yankee
professors will lie than to believe that stones will
fall from heaven.""
The opinion of intelligent men, especially sci
entists, was undergoing a change, however, at that
time. This was due largely to the investigation by
the French Academy of the shower of meteorites
at Laigle in 1803 The inquiry established so
absolutely the fact that the stones had fallen from
outer space that scientific men were compelled by
logic to believe that such showers could occur else
where. And since the fall at Laigle, when two to
three thousand stones descended, no less than eleven
such showers have been recorded. In the shower
of Pultusk, Poland, in 1868, one hundred thousand
stones are estimated to have fallen, the total weight
reaching over four hundred pounds. In a shower
at Mocs, Germany, in 1882, more than three thou
sand stones fell.
In the United States, about seven hundred and
fifty pounds of meteoric matter descended at Esther
ville, Georgia, in 1879. Several thousand stones
fell over an area nine miles in length and one mile
wide near Forest City, Iowa, in 1S90. These show
ers were marked by extraordinary phenomena of
light and sound, making them events never to be
forgotten by those fortunate enough to witness
By Charles F. Holder
them. And such showers thus far have been
strangely free from fatalities. , <r.- 5 i
In ancient times when nearly everyone was super
stitious, there was less skepticism about meteorites
than a hundred years ago, when scientists insisted
upon seeing with their own eyes before believing.
The people of antiquity thought the fiery visitors
from other worlds messengers from the gods.. Tem
ples were built for them, they were decorated and
worshiped as divine, and coins and medals were
struck in their honor. Thus the omphalos of Delphi
is represented on coins of sixtv-five towns, and one
collection in the American Museum of New York
contains sixty coins representing nineteen deities
and thirty-seven towns. The early Greeks called
them Bzetvlus, doubtless meaning the home of God.
Solving the Mystery
TRILLIONS of meteors have shot across the sky,
but it was not until modern times that man at
tempted to solve the mystery as to the actual nature
of the falling stars. On any pleasant night when the
moon is absent the meteorite may be seen. A star
appears to dart from its niche, and with fiery train
dashes athwart the sky. Sometimes it is in a
straight line, again curved. Sometimes it explodes
and affects strange shapes, and they come from any
and all points, and constitute, whether singly or in
showers, one of the most striking and beautiful of
all natural phenomena.
The modern astronomer was the first to make
collections and study them, and as a result there
are several large accumulations in the world. The
largest is the meteorite collection in the Natural
History Museum in Vienna. Representatives of
five hundred showers are there. That of Professor
Ward in the American Museum contains six hundred
and three distinct meteorites, two hundred and
forty-one siderites, twenty-eight siderolites, and
three hundred and thirty-four eolites; two hundred
and twenty-nine of which were from North America,
two hundred and thirteen from Europe, the re
mainder from all over the world. The total collec
tion weighs fifty-five hundred pounds.
An analysis of these show that they do not mate
rially differ from the earth, and their presence is
explained by assuming that in the dim past two
worlds, planets, or suns have crashed together, and
the surviving wreckage distributed through space
in showers of metal and stone ranging in size from
atoms to pieces as large as a house. That such a
collision is possible is suggested by the sudden ap
pearance of brilliant stars where previously nothing
had been seen, suggestive of some vast conflagration
in space, due to the collision or contact of mighty
bodies. Such may have been Tychos, a star which
suddenly appeared in 1572, became as bright as
Venus and disappeared in fifteen months; or Nova
Auriga1, which appeared in 1892, apparently be
tween December 8 and 10.
The great unknown, dark, cold beyond compre
hension, contains innumerable bodies known as
meteorites, and as the solar system moves on its
various members attract them and all are revolving
about the sun. They plunge down to the moon,
and if she is without an atmosphere, crash on her
plains and mountains, probably of vast size. If
they strike the sun, doubtless they melt long.before
they reach it, and by some it is believed that the
heat of the sun is augmented by this supply. When
the iron bodies strike the earth, they find its imme
diate surface protected by a layer of air, a cushion
that acts like a rubber tfce to the globe. The
meteors come in all directions at a rate of twenty
five miles a second. Some strike and bound off
into space; others again are held, and the moment
they experience the atmosphere, or at about seventy
five miles from the earth, their enormous velocity
is arrested. Air is piled up in front like water
before a blunt-bowed ship The friction fuses the
mass, the stone or metal blazes out, the light is
swept behind like the tail of a rocket for forty or
fifty miles, and the typical shooting star bursts
upon the eyes of wondering humanity?one of the
common splendors of the night.
When the World Is Struck
TF the object is large, its surface alone burns, and
* the interior penetrates the envelop and strikes the
earth and becomes buried in the soil, or the
impact is so tremendous that it explodes in mid-air,
scattering blazing fragments all along the line of
approach. But by far the greater number are
totally destroyed and blaze up fitfully as they strike
the air, and then settle upon the earth as cosmic
dust. When we consider that millions of meteorites
are striking the earth yearly, it is evident that over
the entire surface of the globe a rain of dust is slowly
settling down. The evidence of this is metallic
dust found by NordenskjOld on the sun fields of the
far North. He estimated this cosmic dust on
the ice fields of Spitzbergen at about one millegram
to the square foot. This for the globe means a fall of
iron equivalent to half a million tons a year; and as
this has been going on for millions of years it is
evident that the earth has increased in size from
that source of supply. Dust of this kind has been
dredged from the deep sea by the various expedi
tions, and caught in specially designed traps on the
tops of high mountains.
While the earth is continually receiving these
missiles, they appear in greater numbers at certain
times, and are in this way traced to comets; so we
may say that the greater number of meteorites
which fall have approached the earth in the train
of comets. First, they have been a part of a planet
that, destroyed, now rushes through space as a
comet, thousands of miles wide, but exceedingly
diffuse. The comet is wrecked, perhaps loses its
tail or train, which moves on, invisible except when
the earth dashes through it and attracts the objects
which dash down into our atmosphere as meteors.
This is well shown by following the history of some
well-known comet. So all these meteorites are
pieces of the wrecks of comets."

By Dr. W. H. Ballou.
WHETHER the world apon which we
lire is the only one on which
there is life?as we know life, or
whether throughout space there spin other
worlds on which dwell plants and living,
mobile creatures, has long been a bitterly
contested question.
It has been answered definitely and
finally, Science now believes, in the af
flrmatlve.
Meteors falling to our earth's surface
out of the illimitable interstellar depths
have been subjected to the most exacting
microscopic and chemical analysis. Under
this they have revealed not only the min
eralised forms of such lower *s
the crinoids?to which the star-isb and the
sea-urchin belong?corals and sponges, but
pent and coal as well. Furthermore, in
some of these aerolites water has been
found end in others oiygen!
These four things imbedded in the stony
masses form a message compact, unequivo
cal and startling. They show that the
world they have been torn from must have
been much like our own. The crinoids,
sponges and corals prove that it possessed
?n ocean; the peat and ooal that it had
vegetation; the water and oxygen that it
possessed as atmosphere.
Where rolled that world of which the
meteorite was a part? What ruled it
creatures comparable to man, lower forms,
higher forms, or strange shapes produced
by processes of evolution unknown to us
here? And what happened to that world?
The flrst and second questions eaa be
guessed at only. Anything might have
become Its dominant race, ft might hare
been a planet of oar own solar system, de
stroyed aeons ago?It might have been a
world spinning about a sun Incalculable
distances away from us.
Bat to the third question there is a defi
nite answer. Whatever world tt was of
whieh tt was a pert was destroyed la some
vast eatactysm that sent Its fragments
hurtling through the void like those of an
sxplodin* shell!
Bat, It win be asked, oould not these
aerolites or meteors be parts of our own
sarth projected Into space beyond the
range of earth's gravitation In the frightful
volcanic convulsions of the past?
Meteors are of two kinds?tne stony or '
I! tholites, and the metallic fragments which
contain no trace of stoay matter. The
evidences of organic life are found only in
the tholites; the metallic meteors are
composed entirely of iron, with now and
then traces of oobalt, chromium, tin, sul
phur, arsenic, phosphorus, aluminum, ohlor
ine, nitrogen, hydrogen end carton.
It is true that no element has sver been
found in any meteor which is opt also
found In ssrth.
But this is offset in the cases of the me
talllc meteors by ths fact that thslr crys
tallisation is absolutely unlike any crystal
lisation of any Iron yet found within earth
?a difference so striking that It Is one of
the things that ensbls scientists to tell at
once whether the sutostaace before them Is
or Is not meteoric, it Is further offset by J
ths fact that about no volcano on earth are
such susses of mstal found. Volcanoes do
not eject maasee of iron and never did.
This would seem to dispose of the metal
meteore as earth exiles, returning home
nftor long voyages in the infinite.
The same argument as to the volcanoes
applies to the UthoUtos. And volcanoes
are the only guns ws have ever had capable
of shooting any objects outside the influ
ence ot earth's gravitational foroe.
But beside that the total maee of the
meteors alone whose orbits, llks the pfru
ets, are around our own sun, Is inconceiv
ably vast Unless we are prepared to sd
mit that our earth shot off at least a thou
sand times its own present bulk into space
before it steadied down, we are up a
stump. There are eountlees other swarms
which do not revolve around our sun.
Thers Is, too, another law. Involving cslss
tial mechanics, the poeslbUity of return to
our owa comparatively tlay sphere, and
???y other things which space forbids go
ing Into here.
It can be set down that Science, on suf
ficiently good grounds, has dismissed fin
ally the theory of meteors being volcanic
debris of our own world.
The conclusive evidence that the stony
meteors were ouoe parts of worlds llks
oar own has been provided by seoree ot
thew Utholites, but mainly by ons that

ARIZONA METEORITE
ATTRACTS CROWDS

MUSEUM
Chicago. Julv 14. Both
scientists and the general
public are showing interest
in the ""Navajo"" meteorite,
which has has just been
Dlaced on exhibiton at the
""Field Museum of Natural
History. This meteorite is
one of the largest that has
been discovered in recent
years It is solid metal and
weighs 3,306 pounds. It
was found near Navajo,
Arizona, about one hundred
miles from the point whsre
the Canyon Diablo f?.ll of
meteorites was discovjred.
This meteorite apparently
was known to the Navajo
Indians who entered Ari
zona several hundred years
ago. The Indians, covered
the meteorite with stones
so that no other Indians or
white men could find it,
as they considered it sacred.
It was located recently on
government land. The find
ers staked a mining claim
around it and finally sold it
to the Field Museum by the
pound. Scientists who have
examined it say it differs
in several ways from the
Canyon Diablo meteorites.
The mass of metal is about
33inch.es long and 26 inches
high. It is partly split open
on one side. There are
some marks, made with
tools, which are thought to
: be of prehistoric origin.

THE RIGHT THING
at the
RIGHT TIME
By MARY MARSHALL DUFFEE
PARENTS FORGET
THERE Is a rule of good form that
tells us that we should never re
prove a servant or other employee in
the presence of outsiders. A waitress
perhaps breaks a dish at dinner and
the confused hostess exclaims hastily
that she should not be so awkward oi
sunt she has been very careless. Now,
the perfectly well-bred hostess does not
do this. She does her best at the time
to draw her guests' attention from the
mishap and, if she feels that any re
proof is necessary, she waits until she
is alone with the servant.
Now, if we are as considerate as
this to servants, ought we not to be as
considerate to our children? Tet,
truly, I know plenty of persons who
would not think of reproving servants
In my presence, especially nowadays,
when servants are so Independent and
hard to get,-ho would not think it
anything amiss to scold their children
in my presence.
Sometimes the scolding Is delivered
in a half-teasing, jesting manner.
""John, will you be careful?"" exclaims
the mother to her ten-year-old . son,
when he is trying to bring her some
article that she has sent for. ""You are
the most awkwatd creature in the
world. Your feet are so big it's no
wonder you trip over them."" And then,
to her guest: ""Just imagine, John
wears shoes that are larger than mine
already. I suppose he is going to have
enormous feet like his father.""
- It may be that John is sensitive. He
was doubtless trying to do the errand
graceful- and carefully, and it hurts
him to b? reproved for his failure to
do so. Moreover, he feels sensitive
about those big feet. He knows that
the only reason his parents tease him
about them is because he cannot come
back at them and make teasing re
marks about their infirmities.
Now, really, does It seem fair? If
you want td reprove John and humble
him perhaps you are justified, but
you ought at least to be as consider
ate to him as you would be to a serv
ant and do it when there is no third
nerson present.

ANOTHER SUNDAY TALE.
Washington, Dec. 3+l President Grant, in
tho course of a conversation with a representa
tive of the Associated Press to-day, said, In re
ply to a question, that he had no knowledge of
a Democratic armed conspiracy, South or West,
as bad been reported. He had information
merely of organized rifle companies outside of
tbo State Militia, but ho was not apprehensive
of armed collisions in connection with tbo Presi
dency, no matter what might be tho fears of
others. It seemed to him that tho people de
sired only a fair count of tbo Electoral vote In
tbo Southern contested States In order to be
satisfied of the result.
TOE REPORTS OP TUB SEVERAL COMMITTEES
now there would shod lighten tho true condition
of affairs, and have a tendency to solve existing
difficulties. It was certainly desirable to estab
lish the actual fact of tbo election of either
Hayes or Tlldcn, for neither could feel satisfied
If any doubt remained of Ids election, because,
in such o case, his position as President would
not command Urn requisite general support.
The President remarked that no one could sup
pose that he had anr connection with or relation
to the declaration as to who was elected. That
was
NOT A MATTER POR DIM TO DETERMINE.
Ho was anxious for the coming of tho 4th of
March,-wbon he would gladly give way to his
successor and be freed from official cares. Be
fore re-establishing himself at his home In
Galena, 111., be purposed making a voyage to
tbo West Indies, visiting Havana nud other
points of interest. He bad deferred his voyage
to Europe till June. The President, recurring
to the recent election, remarked that he should
promptly recognize whoever should be declared
bis successor. With this his political feelings
would have nothing to do.
A REMINISCENCE.
It would be recollected that several rears
nco. durlog a Gubernatorial contest In the State
of Avk&nsaa, and when both parties represented
their respective eases at Washington, ho recog
nised a Democrat In preference to a Republican
became, by legal representation} the former was
entitled to the position.
TAKIKO TUB OATH.
While it was true that the Presidential term
commences by law on the 4th of March. It did
not necessarily follow that the President-elect
should defer taking the oath of ofllce until that
time. Ho might take It Immediately after the
declaration of his election, but, of course,
could not enter on the pcrformanecof bis duties
as President until the 4th ol March, the date of
the retirement of his predecessor.
TROOPS.
The President Intends replying to the Honso
resolution calling for information os to tbo
sending of troops to the South and the authority
under which ho acted In all such proceedings.
He said he endeavored to keep within
the limits of law, having always,
previous to acting, consulted the Attorney
General, his legal adviser, end, besides,
tbc Democratic House of Representatives dur
ing the former session of Congress emphatically
declared that all citizens of the United States
should bo equally protected In their rights. Ho
further said, with regard to the complaints of
his sending troops to the South for the above
mentioned purpose, that It would bo recollected
that
OBN. PRANK lU.AIB
wanted troops sent thither for a different ob
ject, saying, In bis letter to Col. Drodhead, In
June, 1665, that there was hut ouo way to re
store the Government and the Constitution,
and that was for the resident-elect to declare
tbo Reconstruction acts null and void, and com-
Re! tbo army to undo the alleged usurpations at
le South and leave the while people to reor
ganize their own Governments. ** Surely.”
said tbe President, “ If tbo army, according to
Gen. Biolr, can be used to wipe out Govern
ments, it could, In my opinion, be employed to
support tbem. The Democratic National Com
mittee. otter this letter was written, nominated
Gen. Blair for Vice-President ou the ticket with
Gov. Seymour-
TOE REPUBLICAN STATE OOVEUNMBKTS
at tho South had uolUlog to expect from tbe
Democrat*. Under their rule all such Govern*
menu would fade out, as In Mississippi, where
Gcu. Ames was legally elected Governor, but
was forced to vacate tuo otUce, and is now a
fugitive from tho State.""
GROVER.
THAT UN ENVIABLY FAMOUS MAN IN SAN FRAN*
CISCO.
Ban Francisco, Dec. 24.—Gov. Grover, of
Oregon, arrived by steamer this evening, and
was waited upon by a number of prominent
Democrats and represenUtives of tho press.
Grover stated that the report of the Repub
lican Electors, to tbo effect that they did not
refuse to act with Cronin, was not correct;
that they did so refuse, and compelled Cronin
to adopt tbe course be followed In organizing
his Board of Electors. Ho denied the report
that bo bad his bouse under guard through
fear of violence, but that Republicans threaten
ed to burn him in cQlgy tu front of bis own res
idence, sod bis friends gathered there to pre
vent any such proceeding. He denied with
much apparent Indignation the statement that
his action was in obedience to instructions from
tbe East, or that bis published statement has
been scut out to him for signature, is rumored,
claiming that his action was in conformity with
his views after a careful consideration of the
law In tbe cose, and that bis statement was en
tirely bis own creation, but admitted (hat,
pending a decision of tbe matter, he was
in receipt of tho odvico of parties
East. 'Gov. Irwin, who was present,
volunteered a statement that no thinking Dem
ocrat claimed that It was a settled thing that
tbe Issuance of a certificate to Cronin set
tled tbo election of Tilden, but that it would
compel Congress to go behind the face of the
returns, which was tbe object which Gov. Grover,
os a good Democrat,' sought to sttalo by bis
action on a legal technicality. ThU view of tbo
matter was corroborated by Judge Hsgsr and
other prominent Democrats present. To-
morrow evening Ororcp wfjl have a public re
ception, tendered bv the Democratic Convention.

TDK LAFATBTTB DEMOCRATS.
Special Dispatch to TM TVrftus/.
T Lafatstte, lad M Dec. 24.—The County Con
vention called for Saturday, in response'to the
call of the Democratic Slate Centra) Commit
tee, met in the Court-llouSb at Ip. ro. For
some reason an organization was not eifcctcd
till after 2. There seemed to be a disposition
among prominent Democrats to hang ' back.
None were rampant to take an active part in
the proceedings, and continued running to and
fro, buttonholing and whispering among the
faithful. Finally John S. Williams called the
meeting to order and L. B. Stockton was called
to the chair. Mr. Stockton said bo did not
feel fully posted as to the design of the
Convention, and hoped, if he faded to state Its
real object, some one would explain more fully
than be was able to. On motion, a committee
of Are were appointed to draft resolutions ex
pressive of the scntlmeoltfldfrn meeting, and to
select delegates to attend tmnstatc Convention
of Jan. 8. The Committee, after retiring a few
minutes, reported a list of delegates and reso
lutions. Tha supposition Is that they wcroallln
TUB CROWN OF WILLIAMS* HAT
before thu meeting was called to order. One of
the most prominent Democrats placed on the
Committee was not present, and had nothin? to
do with It, although his name was used in tost
connection. There was nothin? startling or
novel In the resolutions. They declared their
belief In the election of TildcQ and Hendricks;
placed themselves on record as law-abiding cit
izens; claimed that no power but tho joint
action of botb Houses of Congress could legally
count the Electoral Votes for President end
Vice-President, and that the attempt to declare
Haves and Wheeler’s election by proclamation
of the President of the Senate, or any other one
man, would be an assumption of authority
never before claimed or exercised, and be
hoved it
wour.o ns resisted nr tub proplc,
irrespective of party. Williams madu a speech
in support of tho resolutions, basing his claims
ol the election of Tlldcn and Hendricks because,
tho morning after election, all the capers had
announced it, and among tho States conceded
by tho Republicans at the time were Louisiana,
Florida, and South Carolina. Hu also attempt
ed to prove that the Republicans had previously
arranged to count these doubtful States for
Hayes and Wheeler whether or no, by an Inter
view given with Murat Halstead, just before tho
election, In which Halstead stated this to he tho
■ intention substantially of the Republican lead
ers. The report of the Committee was unan
imously adopted, and tho Convention adjourned,
Tho room wos comfortably Oiled, nearly ono
half being Republicans, present out of curiosity
to hear the Democratic war-talk. The mans
f ers of the Convention evidently had no appe
ite for war. They oil expect to die at home
and In their own buds, If they bare any say la
this matter.
LAPORTE.
Special JHtpaUA to The Tribune.
Lapobte, Ind., Dec. 24.—The Democracy of
this county met la convention at the Court-
House yesterday afternoon. Delegates were
appointed to attend the Convention at Indian
apolis Jan. 8. Resolutions were passed protest
ing against the acts of the Administration and
dispensing condolence to tbe unwashed. No
fear of war here. The butt of a musket would
ho a terror to them.
FORT WATNE.
Special Dispatch to The Tribune.
FORT Watne, Ind., Dec. 24.—The nnterrifled
Democracy of Allen County aired their indigna
tion over their failure to elect Tilden and Hen
dricks at the Court-House this afternoon. The
attendance was not' largo. The meeting was a
cut-end-dricd affair, officers, resolutions, and
delegates to the State Convention having been
arranged In star-chamber several days ago. The
Hon. A. B. Edgorion presided, and opened pro
ceedings by reading a speech from manuscript.
A number of epeeencs were made, oil the ora
tors asserting that Tildcn must bo inaugurated,
but none of them calling for “wall.” Henry
M. Williams tiled a protest as a Republican,
asserting (hat Tildcn fairly carried tho Stufn of
Louisiana, and demanding that, if its vote Is
not counted for him, it roust bo excluded
altogether. Tho Democrats were jubilant over
this, but, as Mr. Williams voted for Greeley and
Tildcn. bo cannot be considered very much of a
Republican. Tlntresolutlons are very long and
verbose. They Insist' that Tilden has been
elected and must lib Inaugurated, hint that the
onlv compromise width can bo considered would
be a new election lo all tbe States, and slyly In
sinuate' that a concession, for the sake of
peace, to illegal and arbitrary power,
whether bv the Federal Government or
Returning Boards, may result in evils more de
plorable In their consequences than even civil
wor. The resolutions also denounced tho use
of troops In Bouth Carolina and other parts of
the South, and expressed approval of Wade
Hampton’s course. Delegates were appointed
to the Btb of January Convention at Indlanap
oils, after which the meeting adjourned. The
demonstration was far less formidable in point
of numbers than anticipated, either by Demo
crats or Republicans, and was strictly a partisan
affair.
FLORIDA.
TUB WORK OF TUB SUmBMB COURT.
New York, Dec. 24.—A Timet special from
Tallahassee says that Uie decision of the Su
preme Court in the mandamus case was deliv
ered at 5:80 o'clock Friday last.. It enforces
the doctrine that all questions of Irregularity
or fraud In elections are judicial, be-*
longing to the Courts oud not to the
Board of State Canvassers, unless
the returns arc not regular or genuine.
Thus, if the Inspectors at a poll stuff the
ballot-box oud change the result, If they duly
certify the result of their act, and the County
Canvassers send up a return in due form, such
returns are genuine for any purposes of the
Slate Board. Hence,
TUB COURT ORDBRS
the Manatee County returns to be counted,
where the protended election was conducted
with no moro rpgird to legal forms than the
action of a street mob. Jackson County Is
ordered to be counted, where at every precinct
voters were compelled to pass their ballots up
Into windows seven feet from the ground, and
where there Is the clearest evidence that the
Republican votes cast were not counted, but
that Democratic ballots were stuffed in their
stead.
Monroe County is also ordered to be counted,
when it la admitted by the Precinct Inspectors
themselves that they adjourned on the night
of election to a place two miles distant,
m order to await the result at
other precincts and ascertain how much It woa
necessary to add for them to give a Democratic
majority in the county, Hamilton County is
ordered to bo counted, whore the Inspectors,
who were all Democrats, and not Republicans,
aa boa been asserted, deserted the polllng-
J daces and let others, aomu of them candidates
or the Statu Legislature, count the ballots and
get up a certlilcute of the result.
ALL TUBSB GROSS FRAUDS •
and Irregularities are ignored, and the counts
are to bo canvassed unpurged, because on their
face tbo returns ara regular and genuine. It Is
the opinion of the beat lawyers here that there
is neither Uw, Justice, nor sense In the order of
the Court. They say that the statute elves the
Hoard power to exclude fraud-tainted products.
This is Us meanlur, or It means nothing. The
decision is inconsistent with itself In
Us various propositions, for it asserts
the power of the Board to consider evidence
outside the returns in one sentence, and denies
Uin another. U also denies the exercise of dis
cretion on the part of the Board, and yet says
that U)o statute of 1873 was passed to give the
Board more scope far the exercise of discretion.
Tbo order, however, is generally considered here
as setting the proposition that a return, lair on
ita face, signed by the proper ofllccrs at tbo
properUme,
MUST BB COUNTED,
no matter what frauds It conceals, but that,
if It Is so ambiguous and uncertain In any of Its
statements that the actual vote coat or asserted
by It to bo cost Is In doubt, then the county af
fected by such returns must be excluded. The
Board cannot go lack to precinct returns or
anywhere else to count It. So, also, if there are
two or moro. rUurus from u county,
the Board must take tho one regular
on Its face and reject oil consideration
of the others. These principles, applied by tho
State Board, will give all tho counties above
named to the Democrats, will restore to Demo
crats and Republicans respectively all tho single
votes thrown out, sad deduct all that were add
ed. It will also coapel tho Board to count ibo
returns from Baker County signed by tho,
County Judge, Sheriff, and Justice of tbo Peace,
which would give n net majority for Tildcn In
the Stale of forty-four voter. The decision of
the Court and the mandate that follows
BTHICTLT APPLY TO THIS GOVERNORSHIP,
and no other officer. The Board are ordered to
reassemble and canvass as to the office of Gov
ernor alone. The Electoral vote In not affected
by ft, and It Is not decided, therefore, that the
Democrats are entitled on the Electoral vote to
the fruits of their frauds; but were this other
wise, giving them these fruits, the decision
(rives the State to Hayes for President, and
this was undoubtedly what was contemplated
by the Court. Obedience to the mandate of the
Court will give the State to the Democrats, and
it does not now sectn that anything can prevent
the result.
TITS UTMOST CONSTERNATION

ally apparent in the colored people who are die
po«ed to look at the situation under Democratic

NOTES.
MORRISON'S BULLDOZE.
Special Dispatch to The Tritmne.
Washington, D. C., Dec. 24.—A letter to a
prominent Kcpublfcan member of the House
from Near Orleans says the Democrats on the
Committee tbcrc do not consult the Republican
members lo regard to any of the work on band,
and that Morrison is conducting his Investiga
tion in about the sdrao style adopted by most of
the Democratic committees last winter, where
everything, os far as possible, was kept secret
from the Republican minority*
A SIDE-SHOW PROPOSED.
A wild Tildcn and Hendricks Club has taken
upon Itself to arrange for Tildcn's inauguration,
and bos made propositions lo rent one of the
market-houses of the cltv, and has bad esti
mates made of the cost of putting in the neces
sary platforms and scats.
FLORIDA.
One claim of the Democrats here in regard to
Florida is, that, while the Court may not have
legal authority to convene another Electoral
College after the time fixed by the United States
law for its meeting, a decision of the Court will
be equivalent to declaring the vote of tbe ElecU
oral College os already cast illegal, and so com
pel the joint Convention to throw it out.
OEN. RUSK, OP WISCONSIN.
The Democrats arc exceedingly busv trying
to create the Impression that the Republicans
here are weakening. Among the latest stories
in this Una is one that (ten. Rusk, of Wisconsin,
declares privately that Tildcn was undoubtedly
elected and should be Inaugurated. So far from
this having the least foundation, Gen. Rusk de
clares openly his belief that Hayes did carry
North Carolina, Bouth Carolina, Florida, ana
Louisiana, and would have carried Mississippi
with anything approaching an honest vote.
SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS DISGUSTED.
The Southern Democrats in Congress arc be
coming restive, and complain hlttcrlv of their
treatment bv their Northern allies. They say
that they have done oil In their power to secure
the election of two Northern Democrats, Tildcn
and Hendricks, although neither of those gen
tlemen has shown anyucslrutorcstorethcfancn
fortunes of tbe South. In tbe Hou«o of Repre
sentatives three Northern Democrats—Kerr,
Cox, and Saylcr—were successively elected
Speaker during the last session, and now Ran
dall, another Northern Democrat, has been
elected. The Important positions on tho
House Committees have been appropriated
by the Northern Democrats, and they
have filled at least two-thirds of the offices of
the House. In short, the Southern Democrats
are becoming dissatisfied and tho noisy war
talk of tho Northern friends of Tilden Is In
creasing their discontent.
A PHENOMENON PROMISRD.
Among other demonstrations that the Demo
crats arc getting up for St. Jackson’s-Day, Jau.

vention of colored citizens to bo held here.

THAT METEORITIfI
____________ i “ * v-
Its Track “ Across the Con
tinent.”
Where It Came From, and
What Has Become of It.
A Glance at the Mathematics of
the Subject.
A World Baptized with
Fire,
Answer to the Question, « Whith
er Are Wo Drifting? ”
“Did you see It! Did you bear itl ” were the
questions addressed in general conversation
during Friday and Saturday. No one needed to
be told that the “It” referred to was the
brilliant meteoric phenomenon of Thursday
evening. And to Tan Tnimms other questions
have come pouring In; such as,—“What was
It! Where did it come from! Where has It
gone to!” It Is no wonder that an extraor
dluary degree of interest was awakened by tbo
unexpected display of celestial pyrotechnics,
as It was exceptionally grand and Imposing,—
much more so than any that was ever before
witnessed by white men In this region.
ITS VISIBLE FLIGHT.
The path of the stranger during its visible
career may be nearly found from a comparison
of tbo numerous observations made; though
many of these are too vague to bo of value In
determining position and distance, and only one
or two give precise Information. Tho expres
sions from “southwest to northeast, 11 or from
“west to cast,” are not definite enough to sat
isfy tho mathematician, and oven the statement
that tho body “ passed overhead “ may mean
anywhere within ten degrees of tho zenith point.
The Rev. 8. B. Ooodenow, of Cbandlcrvllle, 111.,1s
the only one who has sent us a description of
the path, which could be used In conjunction
with others In calculating the height of the me
teorite, and the precise points over which it
passed. Wc should probably have received
more definite Information, but for tho fact that
It was too cloudy at many places to permit the
stars to be seen. This was tho cose at Chicago.
If the observer noto the stars across which, or
near which, the meteorite seems to pass, tho al
titude and azimuth of those stars at tbo time
can be calculated at leisure, and tho apparent
position of the body be thus found. A mathe
matical comparison of such observations made
at two or more places, far enough apart, will
give tho course and height of the moving body.
From a comparison of the crude descriptions
given, wc conclude that the following Is an ap
proximate statement of the path pursued by
tho meteorite while visible. From some point
southwest by west of Lawrence, Kan., to Miami
County, on tbo eastern border of that State;
across Missouri, from Cass to Marion Counties;
across Illinois, from Adams to Iroquois Coun
ties; across Indiana, from tho southern portion
of Newton County to Fort Wayne (Allen Coun
ty), from, there across Ohio to tbo southern
point of Lake Eric, and over tho northwestern
corner of Pennsylvania Into New York State.
Tho distance was nearly 1,000 miles; the time at
Chicago about Bb. 85m. p. m., of Dec. 21,1870;
the height above tho earth’s surface some aev
enty-flvo miles when over Kansas, to fortymlles
when over Ohio. Its probable size—of that we
may have something to say anon.
A line drawn upon tfao nap, through the
places above Indicated will not bo a straight
line; It. will be slightly convex towards the
north, but scarcely bends out so much as would
a great circle of the sphere if drawn through
the east and west extremities of the line. The
piano of the risible path, if produced, would
pass some distance north from the earth's cen
tre. The plane of the motion was Inclined about
15 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic.
WIIEKR IT CAMS FROM.
Our celestial visitor came to us after even n
more extended travel than that of Satan, when
(see Job, 1., 7) he presented himself before tbe
Lord after “ going to and fro tn the earth, and
from walking up and down In it.’* Our meteorite
came to us from the depths of space; where, for
aught wo know, It may have been pursuing an
Individual flight during many millions of cen
turies. The accompanying diagram MU enable
a.
;
\0 «-/
our readers to form a general idea of the rela
tion of oar visitor, ami similar bodies, to the
world on which wo dwell.
Tlie circle, of alput 1.4 Inches In diameter,
represents the earth's orbit. Tbo arrows Indi
cate the direction of her movement, tbo north
pule being above the piano of the paper. Tho
elilpio represents the path of the 14 meteorite,""
the direction of motloq being also Indicated by
arrows. Of course tho reader will understand
that tho size of tho ellipse, as compared
with the earth’s orbit, and tho proportion
of Its longest to Us shortest diameter,
are not necessarily those Indicated by the
figure. Tho two orbits Intersect at A; they do
not necessarily Intersect at any other point,
though so represented In tho diagram. It Is
evident that the meteorite may travel around
the aun In Its prolonged elliptic path, and the
earth In her more nearly circular orbit, during
countless ages, wlthoutoncu meeting; Just as
two ships may cross and rccross the Atlantic In
opposite directions many times without 44 sight
ing "" each other,—much loss colliding. But If
when the earth Is at the point A, tho
meteorite ho also .very near the com
mon j>ofnt of intersection, there Is than danger
of a collision. Whether they will really collide
or not depends upon the circumstances of the
case. The meteorite Is traveling at the rate of
(say) 90 mllca per second, and tbu earth with a
speed of miles (at this time of the year the
earth’s velocity ts u .little greater than that);
and tho earth is contluuailypulllug the stranger
towards her by the force or attraction, at a rale
which can be rigidly calculated through all the
variations In their distance. If, now, we should
project (portions of) the two orbits on paper,
mark oil ution them tho place which each
body would occupy at successive In
stants, If there was ’no mutual attraction,
and then set off from the meteorite path,
towards the earth's places, the distances through
which the body is drawn by tho earth’s attrac
tion. wo should have the actual path of (ho mo
.teorltu with reference to tho earth; and could
see by Inspection whether tbu two would col
lide, or pass cods other. In case tho meteorite
PRICE FIVE CENTS,
I®, to P**s Into the earth's Atmosphere, t
lurtner correction must be made lor the retard'
ation of speed duo to resistance of the airs and
tno figure would then show the least distance
between the two bodies.
It Is evident that the result of the approach
Ju c *. han . go l° .the shape of the meteorite
orbit, without a destruction thereof. The body
may even come so near us as to pdas through
the upper atmosphere, and bo Intensely heated
oy the friction, but pass on In an alteredcourse:
as was the case with the brilliant meteorite of
the Sth of July last. Its direction may be such
that lt will reach the earth, as did the one which
fell Into the Pacific Ocean near San Francisco a
few days ago.
W® hnvo Indicated, above, the method in
which the result could be calculated, If we knew
beforehand the original orbit of the meteorite.
Unfortunately, wo cannot know this: because It
Is too small a body to be seen by us till after It
™ i, *9 tcd «P by friction with the air.
The philosophy 0 f the reasoning is not
altered by this fact, only Us method; wo have
to work backwards In Uie calculation, Instead
of forwards. Having the observed path of the
J**ly at any. given time, and knowing
that of the earth, if the astronomer can make
allowance for the effects of gravitation and air
res stance, he can ascertain the direction in
... “ ,Q object was traveling before It became
visible. In this way lie can calculate the path
the traveler In space, and find that it ban
orbit haying the sun In one focus, like that rep
resented (u our diagram. And Id this way wo
find that oil our bolides and shooting stars,
even to the smallest speck which reaches the
earth s surface ns a single grain. of dust (ashes)
come to us from going up and down In the vast
depths of the solar system.
COMPOSITION OP TIIESB BODIES.
There Is, however, one other fact which Is In
volved In considering the question whether, un
(Jcr certain geometrical circumstances, the body
would fall to the earth or not-—the character of
the material of which It Is composed. The
friction of the atmosphere retards the motion,
and that arrested motion o! the moss la con
verted Into motion of Us constituent molecules
or atoms—lt Is changed Into heat. Tbo tem
perature of the body 1* raised to the point ol
Incandescence, and may be increased many
thousands ol degrees. The exterior portions
are heated more rapidly than the Interior, as the
heat Is generated irom without; and this un
equal heating causes unequal expansion of the
particles, so that there Is a continued tendenn
to break up from the outside. The disjoined
R articles fall away, and aru left behind, because
lie surface exposed to atmospheric resistance Is
greater in proportion to the quantity of motion
in the mass for small bodies than for largo ones
of the same materia). If, now, a largo meteor*
lie were composed entirely of Iron, the co
hesive attraction of Its particles might be (un
doubtedly would be) great enough to withstand
this strain; and the mass would continue Its
journey Intact, except a comparatively small
loss by oxidation. If, again, tbo composition of
the meteorite be something like that ol Ibc feet
of Nebuchadnezzar’s (mace—which were “part
ly of Iron and partly of clay tbo more
“ earthy “ matter would bo broken off, as In the
former case, leaving the Iron to fall as a
metallic mass to the earth, or to take another
excursion In space, us determined by the geo
metrical relations above described. This ap
pears to have been the composition of tno
meteor of last Jut}'. Wo remark here that the
finding of an Iron meteorite bv no means prove?
that It was chiefly composed of Iron before colli
sion with tho earth. Its larger portion of less
cohesive matter may have been slouched off In
Its passage through the air, and Vouched tho
surface of the earth os mere atoms of star-dust.
On the other hand, as was undoubtedly tbo
ease with tho meteor of last Thursday, the mass
may bo chiefly composed of material which, for
want of a more expressive term, we may call
“earthy, l *—that Is, less cohesive than Iron, it
may consist principally of tho leading compo
nents of clay, flint, lime, salt, potash, or coal,—
all of which have been found in meteorites. In
this case the circumstances favor a scries nf
disruptions at Intervals nil through Its visible
course; tho exterior surface being cracked oil
by tho unequal heating, and giving rise to many
explosions, as described hy the observers of l.wf
Thursday’s phenomenon. The Imt of thc.x* ex
plosions would bo the last of the meteorite,—ns
a body,—Httlo or nothing being left to pursue
Its journey out of and bovund the earth's alim *■
phcrc.
LITTLE .WOULD* OK PIKE.
Wo do not propose, In this urtwld, to cnlor
upon a discussion of the chemical constitution ..t
meteorites, or to describe those which have been
found In dUTcrent parts of the world. All l : urt
may be found In the text-books, by these who
wish to read it. But we ought uot to forbear a
few words as to the place of these stia-ico
bodies In the economy of the Universe. Till
within u few years past, though the meteorite!
were believed *to bare come from
outside tbe earth, yet It was
generally thought that there were
very few bodies of matter In the solar system
except the sun, moon, seven planets, some of
them having satellites, and a few comets.
We arc wiser now. The facta of modern as
tronomy tend to the conclusion that the bodice
above referred to arc in number comparable
with those we cannot see unless when they
come near us, as the birds of the air oro to tbo
mutes which exist all around us but uro only
visible when lighted up bv a sunbeam.
Our latest meteorite, a body of probably
more than twenty yards in diameter, Is but otto
of a vast series of Individual masses, ranging
all tbo wa;’ up frojp the bulk of a grain of aaim
to a cloud mass so vast that a ray of light
would require three months to flash 'from ono
side of It to tbe opposite. Our earth is a little
higher up In the scale than the meteorite, as
the sparrow U larger than tUoguaubut both
are subject to the same laws, own u similar ori
gin, and have a similar destiny. Both called
out of the original chaos to subserve a certain
purpose; each ucstlucd to destruction when tbo
work Is performed for which It was created.
Tbo meteorite that rushes blazing through
our atmosphere is u world on Are. It Is not
orobablo that any Bring beings are destroyed by
Urn conflagration, because that little world hud
long since chilled down past the point at which
organized forms could exist on its surface.
But tbe earth la passing slowly towards that
point, too,—as our moon appears to have already
passed It,—and when she has ceased to bo use
lul, ber turn, too, will come, though rannv
long eons of death may precede the grand
collapse. Analogy warrants the Inference that
as our meteorite and our greater world “ must
perish in their turn, and drop to dust,” so the
sun and stars have the same future before
them, lu obedience to the creative flat of Him,
who
Views with equal eyes, as Lord of all,
A hero perish or a sparrow fall;
An atom or a system Into ruin burled,
And now a bubble bunt, and then a world.

In the long run, the cheapest and best light
for use in the family residence, is the incan
descent electric light. Safe; nothing could
be safer. A few days ago a prominent gen
tleman of Honolulu came rushing down to
the office of the Electric Company and said:
""Give me figures for wiring my house, and I
want It done at once; no more lamps for me.
Last night a lamp tipped over ami it came
so near setting fire to the house and burning

This is the sentiment of quite a number in

""The meteorite, which is firmly

window was a light gray dress, plain as to make, cheap
as to material, and years behind the time as to style,
labeled ""Elegant costume Before the window, look
ing at that ""elegant costume,"" with her very heart in
her eyes, stood a little old woman in the picturesque
costume of Volendam. For picturesqueness, comfort
and everyday usefulness, the quaint Dutch costume with
its spotless cap neatly confining the straggling locks,
was so far ahead of the cheap, ugly modern costume
that I silently but fervently hoped that the sturdy
common sense of the working people of Holland would
be slow to a wholesale change from the beautiful old
to the ugly new.
Watering the Garden.
Junior boys and girls who do not like to water
the flowers with the old-fashioned sprinkler, ought to be
compelled to water the huge stretches of gardens in
Holland, where there is no hose as well as no sprinklers
to be had. It takes a wheelbarrow, a cask and a dipper
with a handle three feet long to do the work. Perhaps
it is hard to carry the sprinkler to and from the pump
or hydrant, but certainly that must be a good deal
easier than to have to trundle the heavy, awkward
wheelbarrow out to the garden, and then lift every drop
out with the dipper and aim straight enough to send
the water where it ought to go
Entirely aside from the historic interest connected
with Amsterdam, its struggles in olden times against
oppressors of all nations, and the wonders of the pres
ent age, its dikes, its diamond cutting factories, its
museums of Dutch art, the city offers an almost never
ending panorama of the odd, the quaint, the curious
and the amusing.

CHAPTER VII (Continued).
On the Trail of the Meteorite.
Each man seized one of the rope* that were always
dangling from the side of the vessel in case of accident,
and made quick hitch about his waist, none too soon,
as when Ralph looked up he saw a wall of water ap
proaching them that hid the horizon and towered to an
ominous height
That settles us,"" said Captain Sam, glancing at the
coming monster
'A tidal wave1""
'&t&MBalbd&& _jgs^
whispered the awe-struck sci
entist, feeling for his note-book How high, now would
you
But just then the wall of water struck them as
tho the whole sea had risen The Dolphin nose en
tered it, and for almost a minute the three men were
crushed to the deck, dragged and beaten by an enor
mous weight of watei, then they emerged, more dead
than alive, the Dolphin apparently sliding down the
side of the wave as it passed Ralph and the captain
were washed off and hung by the ropes, but were pulled
aboard just as a smaller sea came suiging along, sweep
ing o\er but not cariymg them off As the party re
gained their feet, they looked astern and saw the great
sea fast disappearing the distance
""I've been to sea nigh on to forty year come Christ-
mas,"" said Captain Sam, coughing violently, ""an* I
never swallowed so much water befoie
""That was a gigantic meteor,"" said the professor,
between his efforts to remove the salt water from his
lungs, ""and we have not a moment to lose
""Why*'"" gasped Captain Sam
""Because if we expect to find it we must follow in
its wake
""What'"" said the old sailor, clapping his hands* on
his knees and looking at the drenched and excited nat
uralist ""Do you mean to say that you would follow
that hissm', steamm', red-hot rock down thru b'lhn' salt
water i
""Why, certainly,"" replied the professor ""Captain
Blake,"" he continued, appealing to that gentleman, as
he untied his life-line and wiped the water from his
eyes, ""it is the chance of a lifetime, you have agreed to
give us a deep-sea dive, and now is the opportunity to
kill two birds with one stone
""You mean to chase the meteor7""
founded captain
""Certainly1
asked the dura-
A heavy body like that will sink after
it reaches a certain depth, and we can easily follow it
down by the tram of air and gas bubbles it will leave
behind.""
The captain was a man for emergencies, and it did
not take him a second to see the point ""All hands be-
low'"" he shouted A moment later the hatch had
clanged to, the party were all below, and the professor
was giving the engineer and helmsman instruction.
""Send her down at full speed at an angle of 45
degrees until we strike the tram of bubbles,"" he ordered.
The word was hardly given before the Dolphin
dipped her bow and with a rush plunged into the sea.
The professor estimated that they had lost ten min
utes, but that the effect of the passage of so hot an ob
ject would make an extraordinary mist or haze in the
water, and all hands gathered about the windows, now
enthused at the idea of following a meteorite under
water.
""We should be somewhere off the New Hebrides,""
said the captain, tilting his campstool to adapt himself
to the slautmg position of the Dolphin, ""and according
to the chart we are in water about eighteen thousand
feet deep"", or, in round numbers, three and a half
miles.""
""Magnificent1""
rejoined the naturalist, rubbing1
his
hands in a self-congratulatory manner. ""Think of It,
my friend,"" he^ continued, tapping Captain Sam on the
shoulder with his long attenuated finger ""we are on,,
the threshold ofa region where absolute stillness reigns,
where a sound has never been heard, where the pressure
powders glass and is three and a half tons to every
square inch of surface in our bodies, where the darkness
is intense, and where the water hovers between ice and
water.""
The professor would have continued, but the tele
phone rang violently from the engine, and as the cap-s^ the initiative 1
THE JOURNAL JUNIOR, MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA, SATURDAY, JUNE 4 1904. 5
tain rushed to it, those at the window saw that the
water had suddenly become obscure, and a second later
the window became dimmed as tho by steam.
""The^rail of the meteor,"" exclaimed the professor,
clapping his hands, ""we have found it.""
""The engineer says that scores of dead fishes are
drifting in the water,"" said Captain Blake.
""Killed by the heat and steam of the meteor,"" said
the naturalist ""All we have to do is to follow the trail
of the dead fish.
The Dolphin had plunged into the pathway of the
meteor, which, as the professor had prophesied, was in
dicated by dead fish and a mass of rising bubbles of air
and. gas
""The meteor evidently shot down at an angle,""
said Captain Blake, as they moved out into clear water
again, ""then, having exhausted its force, it gradually
sank vertically, we tnay now settle
Orders to this effect were given, and with the mass
of rising steam bubbles distinctly visible in the search
light, the Dolphin sank rapidly the general direction
indicated.
Long before two hundred fathoms were reached
it was as dark as night. At five hundred fathoms in the
tropical ocean the thermometer gave 40 degrees Fahr.,
and the voyagers were obliged to doff their summer
clothing and don heavier suits. The professor was im
patient to reach the bottom, and thought the rate of
descent too slow
""It's fast enough for me,"" said Captain Sam, who
was braced back his chair.
""You couldn't go much faster, even if you were
aboard the meteor,"" said the captain ""It takes a heavy
sounding-lead an hour and a quarter to drop 4,500
fathoms, and some few people believe that ships and
other heavy matter never reach the
bottom in greater depths
""Then we may pass the meteor at
that rate,"" said Ralph, laughing.
""Hardly that,"" rejoined the cap
tain, ""but the trail is getting more
and more pronounced as we descend
A school of pyrosomas, or fire
bodies, one of the most remarkable
of all phosphorescent animals, flashed
into view Some were four feet
length, and resembled cylinders of
fire As the propeller struck an!
stirred them up, they seemed to glow
with even greater activity, and blazed
with different colored lights. The
professor induced the captain to stop
BO that he could secure one of these
pnarvelous light-givers, and having
""There it is'"" cried Ralph.
Below them, in the broad glare of the light, ap
pedred ai. indistinct something spreading away on all
sides gradually assuming the shape of a huge irregular
mass, jet black color, from which rose a column of
steam ""The me-
teorite',"" exclaim-
ed the professor
""Stop her'""
shouted the cap
tain thru the tel
ephone.
The flashlight
was directed up
on the mass, and
as the vessel sank
slowly, the colos
sal proportions
of this messenger
from space be
came more and
more apparent.
""It's as big as
a house'"" said
Captain Sam.
""It looks as
large as the State*
House at Boston
to me,"" remarked
Ralph.
""It is marvel-
ous'"" sighed the
professor, ""and
to think we must
leave it here
the wonder of
the ages.""
""Well, it's safe,*
retorted Captain
Sam ""we know
where it is that's
a consolation,
certain.""
The Dolphin
having reached
the bottom, the
voyagers took out
their armor, the
captain assuming

test them. The vessel had fcropped upon
her steel supporters upon a rocky ledge not two hundred
feet from the meteorite, that rose high above them. Aa
the captain descended the steel ladder to the bottom, he
telephoned that there was no ooze and that he felt no
inconvenience from pressure The others then joined
him, gathering about the meteoric stone and gazing at
it in silent wonder as the searchlight was directed over
its irregular and massive proportions. They estimated
that it was over two hundred feet in height, and by pac
ing around it found it to be eight hundred feet in cir
cumference.
""A third of it is buried,"" said the professor. ""It
dropped gently upon this rocky ledge, then fell over
into this mud cul-de-sac and sank into it.""
The meteorite was still emitting columns of steam,
tho in greatly reduced quantities. It was smooth, and
on one side a huge hole was visible, into which the bow
of the Dolphin could have been run for twenty feett
which had been caused by the rapid melting of the iron
as it blazed thru the atmosphere.
""This is undoubtedly the largest meteor ever ob
served and examined,"" telephoned the professor to his
silent companions, who were lost in amazement at the
spectacle. ""The largest stones in collections rarely
exceed one hundred pounds One fell in 1879 that
weighed five hundred pounds, and a mass of meteoric
iron was found in Texas, now in Yale college, that
weighed over sixteen hundred pounds Another, which
I have seen in the Mexican school of mines, which fell
in Chihuahua, Mexico, some years ago, weighed ht
teen tons.""
After the professor had vainly attempted to break
off a piece of the mass, the party turned regretfully
away, and followed by the Dolphin, began the first
personal exploration of the abysmal
ocean three and a half miles from the
surface.
The professor had announced that
he expected* to find living trilobites
and crmoids, and in anticipation of
this he stopped to examine every
small object Ralph finally delighted
him by discovering a few Pentacrin
ltes,animals closely resembling the
old crmoids, which at one time were
among the commonest of marine
forms The explorers followed along
the ledge down a gentle incline, find
ing singular animals at every step.
The professor picked up a coral
(Fungia), and a squid which he
trapped in his net was eagerly
squeezed to see if it had a Belemnite
bone. As they were mo\mg along, a
dark object was seen towering high
above them
""A ship'"" signaled the captain. ""A
ship, as I live'""
At that moment the engineer in the
Dolphin, which was behind them,
sighted it and turned the flashlight
upon the wreck It was what had
once been a full-rigged clipper ship,
now standing almost upright on what
was perhaps the edge of a submarine
volcano.
""This ship must have been here for
years,"" telephoned Captain Blake to
his companions ""She's an old-fash-
cdad.

To demonstrate the intensity of its
light, he swung it from the ceiling in
a glass jar, and extinguished the elec
tric light. He not only read by the
light of the fire bodv, but wrote part
of a description of its wonders by its
own light
The actual descent of the Dolphin
was slow, and some time had elapsed
before the captain announced that the
thermometer stood at 37 degrees
Fahr and that they were 3,500
fathoms from the surface, oi 21,000
Eeet beneath the sea
""Over three miles down""' gasped
Captain Sam.
""Yes, and the trail of the meteorite
is more distinct than ever,"" said the
professor."" It was a beautiful object, now that the
flashlight was turned full upon it, showing a vast ir
regular column or silvery light using upward like a
-gigantic water spout not two hundred feet from them.
""We certainly must be near the bottom,"" said the

Along with the dull routine

Now Her Landlady Is Claiming
Meteorite That Hit Housewife
By th« Associated Brass
SYLACAUGA, Ala., Dec. 11.—
A meteorite which struck an Alar
' bama housewife recently has be
come the center, of a new legal
controversy.
Mrs. Birdie Guy, from whom
Mr. and Mrs. Hulitt Hodges rent
their house, has hired attorneys
to get possession of the nine
pound fragment.
Mr. Hodges had hired an at
torney to get the rock back from
the Air Force after it was seized
for closer examination, and the
meteorite was turned ovpr to Mr.
Hodges’ lawyer in Washington
this week.
.However, Mrs. Guy claims
ownership of the rock. She says
that since it fell on her prop
erty. it belongs to her.
Mrs. Hodges was hospitalized
for about five days after the j
thing from outer space tore
through the roof of the house
and left her brused. Scientists
said this is the first authentic
case in which a human has ever
been struck by a meteorite.
Mr. Hodges says he has re
ceived offers exceeding $5,000
for the rock.
Attorney H. M. Love of Tal
ladega. Ala., who represents Mr.
and Mrs. Hodges, said he had
no fear of losing the metorite
to Mrs. Guy or anyone else.
In a telephone interview, the
lawyer told The Star the frag
ment will be sold as soon as the !
Hodges’ clear claim to it is estab- i
lished. He said they have re
ceived numerous offers ranging
from $2 to more than $5,000. j

in the right pocket of his coat.
At that moment they fired, Ba

Wonder of
the World ,Z
THE ancient Greeks catalogued the
“Seven Wonders of the World”
and it has remained for modern
science to now add an “eight wonder” —
the greatest wonder of them all.
Countless ages ago a gigantic celestial
visitor, bigger than fifty Woolworth build
ings, shot through the sky and shocked
and punctured the peaceful surface of the,
earth—a monster meteor of iron, liberally
mixed with diamonds and precious metals
of priceless value. This monster has now
been found.
For more than a dozen years digging
for it has been going on. The attempt
was abandoned, resumed, again given up
as hopeless.
All of this very quietly; advertisement
of the enterprise was not desired. Now,
at length, it has suc-
ceeded, ami of that
success this is the
first announcement.
Think of a meteor
—a “fallen star”—
more than five hun
dred feet in di
ameter and weighing
twelve million tons!
Was there ever the
like? Not so far as
known, certainly, or
anything in the least
comparable to it.
There are other
things to be said
about it, equally re
markable, as will
presently be seen.
It fell a long time
-—at least many
thousands of years—
ago, near the Canon
Diablo, in Arizona. A lot of stories have
been printed about it, speculatively; for,
in striking the earth, it made a hole two
thirds of a mile in diameter and nearly
circular. The hole, four hundred feet deep,
was originally supposed to be a .volcanic
crater. But geologists declared that noth
ing imaginable could account for it except
the impact of a gigantic meteor, which
must be buried,— a huge mass of iron—
deep in the ground.
If the meteor was Jhere it could pre
sumably be reached by digging. Such an
enormous mass of metal would be worth
a lot of money, leaving out of considera
tion the scientific interest.
So digging was undertaken on an im
portant scale, shafts being sunk, supple
mented by drilling to a depth of nearly a
thousand feet. Nothing came of it.
Indeed, as is now known, the drilling
might have been carried to unlimited
depths without striking the buried meteor.
It was not there.
If not there, where was it? The an
swer, as now known, was that it was out
side the cup of the “crater,” beneath its
eastern rim. Why, will be explained later.
It was finally reached by driving an
inclined tunnel from some distance out
side the east rim, westward and down
ward at an angle of forty-five degrees.
The tunnel, a thousand feet long, came
upon the giant meteor at a depth of about
fiv hundred feet. Kight there the work
men’s picks struck an impenetrable ob
stacle.
Now the problem is to get at the mass
and remove it, necessarily in many pieces.
To lift it out entire is impossible. To get
it out at all is a difficult engineering
operation, but, now that its location is ex
actly known the task reduces itself to
mere terms of labor and cost. Already
work has been begun on a deep open cut.
One reason for the difficulty lies in the
Mining Engineers Missed the Most Startling
Mineral Discovery Ever Known Because They
Neglected to Calculate That the Meteor Plunging
Down from the West Would Be Found East of the
Crater. An Angled Tunnel Has Solved
the Mystery.
fact that meteoric iron is one of the hard
est substances known, containing a con
siderable percentage of nickel ordinarily.
It is, in effect, nickel-steel, and its com
position is said to have given the first
hint for the use of such an alloy in the
manufacture of armor for battleships.
It is going to be a big job, therefore,
to break the mass into removable frag
ments. This is likely to be accomplished
by sawing, rather than by high explosives.
But in the meantime the meteor must be
exposed to view and rendered accessible
by mining.
How, it may be asked, can the job pay,
taking the difficulties into vi w? An
equivalent quantity of iron could surely
be obtained elsewhere much more cheaply.
Ah! There lies the most important
point of the story. It is known with cer
tainty that the meteor contains three
fourths of an ounce of platinum to the
ton. How this is known will presently be
explained.
Do you know how much platinum is
worth to-day? . One hundred and fifteen
dollars an ounce! The weight of the mass
underground is estimated at twelve mil
lion tons. It should, then, contain nine
million ounces of platinum, which, at the
price above mentioned, would have a mar
ket value of more than a billion dollars.
Platinum, weight for weight, has nearly
six times the value of gold. It is an ex
tremely scarce metal, indispensable for
many purposes. We have almost none of
it in this country, nearly all of the world's
supply coming from the Urals in Russia
and from Colombia, South America.
But here, apparently, is a billion dol
lars’ worth of this precious white metal,
dropped upon our territory out of the sky.
A miracle, truly. In respect to platinum,
we shall be lifted suddenly from barest
poverty to almost incredible affluence.
Elaborate experiments made by French
The Willamette Meteorite, Found in Oregon, Appears Large Compared

artillerists not long ago proved that a pro
jectile, striking a mass of rock such as a
cliff, produces an “impact crater” seven
times the diameter of the projectile. The
meteor was, in effect, a projectile, and,
applying this rule, it must have been about
five hundred and fifty feet in diameter
in order to produce the crater here de
scribed in Arizona.
That crater (so to call it) is a most
tremendous dent in the rocky crust of the
earth. Its cup, across the top, measures
thirty-seven hundred feet one way and
thirty-eight hundred feet another way, the
two lines of measurement being at right
angles. The rim, composed of material
forced up by the impact of the meteor in
striking, is a ring-shaped hill two hundred
feet high.
Those figures are needed to give a no
tion of the mightiness of the celestial pro
jectile that hit Arizona in the long ago.
traveling at a speed fifty times that of a
rifle bullet, its impact must have caused
the whole earth to tremble, and doubtless
all Arizona was illuminated for a few
minutes by an uprush of flaming gas.

The giant meteor struck Arizona slant
wise, coming from the west. If it had
descended vertically it would have been
found by digging inside the cup of the
crater. But, coming down at an angle, it
lodged deep down beneath the rim of the
crater, on the east side. The easiest way
to reach it was by starting an inclined tun
nel from some distance outside the rim
on that side, driving it downward and
toward the rim as already described.
Hundreds of fragments, melted and
broken off from the meteor, have been
found in the near neighborhood of the
crater. Their character is unmistakable,
inasmuch as meteoric iron is in structure
and composition unlike anything else in

the world. One of them weighed over a
thousand pounds. All of them were found
on the west side of the crater; none at the
east side. This was good evidence that
the meteor came down with a slant from
the west and toward the east.
In some of the fragments diamonds
were found, colorless, yellowish, blue, and
black. Most interesting. It is supposed
that they were crystallized out by high
heat from carbon in the nu teor. They
were too small to have any commercial
value, but Dr. George F. Kunz, the
famous gem expert, obtained half a
carat’s weight of them by dissolving a
considerable quantity of the iron. Many

The notion originally entertained, that

craters of the moon, which latter, he be
lieved. were scars made by the impact of
“moonlets” that formerly traveled around
the earth in flocks, eventually to be swal
lowed up by the lunar orb.
If so, why might not a giant meteor —
call it a mooniet if you choose—strike
the earth and make just such a crater’
Further study convinced geologists that,
whether Prof. Gilbert’s theory about the
moon was correct or net. the Arizona
crater was almost certainly to be attrib
uted to the impact of a. celestial body.

the idea with money, and undertook to
sink shafts in the big hole.
He found the surface rocks, limestone
and sandstone thoroughly shattered to a

once more to tackle the job.
He has found the meteor. Doubtless a
lot will soon he printed about it in the
newspapers, but this is the first announce
ment. There will be plenty to be said
when the mass is exposed to view and the
wealth it represents has been rendered
available.
Obviously, this meteor, if only by rea
son of its enormous size, reduces the
largest ones hitherto found to an im
portance r< latively trifling. The biggest
heretofore known is the famous Peary
meteorite, found by the Arctic explorer
at Cape York, in Greenland, weighing
thirty-six and a half tons. That meteorite
may be seen today at the Museum of
Natural History in New York.
The next largest meteorite is now in the
city of Mexico. It is shaped like a ham
and weighs about twenty-five tons. It

Henry A. Ward. Mexico.
The third largest meteorite, and the
biggest <>ne ever found in the United
States, is the “Willamette,” now owned
by the Museum of Natural History’ in
New York. It is ten feet long, six and a
half feet high, and four feet three inches
thick, weighing 31,107 pounds.
The finding of platinum in a meteor
altogether new. From a merely scientific
viewpoint, therefore, the presence of that
rare and precious metal in the Arizona
“fallen star” is of utmost interest. Add
to that the diamonds it contains possibly
there may be some big ones in the me
tallic mass—and you have something
worth getting excited about.
Think of a mass of meteoric iron five
hundred and fifty feet in diameter! Con

RÂUMG OM THE OLD FRONTIER
\
Amazing Adventures of Hugh Glass, Who a Century Ago Was Victim of
Fight With Grizzly Bear that Became Classic of the Western Frontiers
Drawing
by
Rto§@I!
THE king of wild beasts of
the Rocky mountains is the
grizzly bear. While sel
dom encountered today except
ing in the remotest and most
inaccessible fastnesses of the
Rockies, this monarch of the
wilderness a century ago was
the one animal which hunters
and trappers considered really
dangerous. Grizzlies were call
ed by the earlier explorers
""white bear,"" and many were
the narrow escapes related by
members of the Lewis and
Clark party and other fron
tiersmen who were attacked by
monsters of this species and
threatened with death in a ter
rible form. There were few
among the mountain men who
had not had disastrous experi
ences with them at one time or !
another.
The grizzly bear is distin
guished from other species ofj
bear by a number of marked
characteristics, such as facial
profile, shape of anterior claws,
color of hair and its lack of abil
ity to climb ti'ees. The color
varies greatly, but there is usu
ally enough white hair in its fur
to give it a grayish color. In
size the grizzly averages about
six feet in length from nose to
tail tip, although they have of
ten been found nine feet, and
some have measured as much
as fourteen feet in length. A
grizzly usually weighs about
five hunderd pounds, but of
course the largest specimens
weigh much more. It is not
only a most powerful brute, but
is extremely tenacious of life.
The male has the reputation
of not being pugnacious, rarely
attacking a man without provo- j
cation, and even when wounded
often attempting to escape un
til brought to bay. The female, j
when her cubs are small, is sav
age and dangerous always.
Either sex of the grizzly, when
thoroughly roused, shows ter
rible rage and strength. Hunt
ers have often noticed that
when struck by a bullet, a griz
zly will start instantly in the
direction from which it comes
without waiting to see its
enemy.
Grizzly Rush Hard to Stop
At close quart its no living thing can
withstand a fighting grizzly. Its at
tack is from a standing position, first
by a blow from its forefoot, followed
by. gnashing and tearing with mouth
and claws. An old hunter gave this
rtlvice: ""Never fire at a grizzly in a
Lurry. Never be stampeded by a bear's
rush. It will always stop, rise on its
hind legs and prepare to strike a side
long blow with itv fore feet. At this
moment, when its head is extended and
in a position in which the bullet will I
not glance, aim between the eyes and
fire and the bear will fall dead. A
shot through the heart frequently will
not stop n grizzly. Many a man has
been killed and horribly mangled by
one of these brutes after it has been
shot through the heart. The only real
ly safe shot is between the eyes or be
hind the ear. Hither kills instantly.""
The most notable story of an en
counter between a white man and a
grizzly was that of Hugh (»lass. Possi

most sensational happenings of the

1823 and was wounded in a fight with

in the party. I'nder Major Andrew

and attacked him before he had time

and lifted him from the ground. Then

lumbered to her cubs, which were close

ATTACKED BY GRIZZLY BEAR
Finally Major Henry induced two mon
by a reward ot eighty-two dollars to
remain with Glass until he should

life was entertained.
A Five Day Vigil
These men stayed with Glass for
five days, when, despairing of his re.

his immediate death cruelly abandoned

One evening he came upon a pack of !
wolves that had surrounded a buffalo j
calf and were attacking it. (!!ass wait-1
rd u n t il it was dead, and then shouted !
and brandishing a stick, frightened
animals away. He had no knife and
no fire, but he managed to tear off
enough meat« from the calf to make a
meal, and eating sparingly, it gave him
strength. When he felt able to go for
ward, he took as much meat, as he
could tarry, and finally, after hard
ships and distress incredible, reached
Fort Kiowa, where he rested for a few
days. Before he was again in fit. con
dition to travel, and with some of his
wounds still in bad shape, he had an
opportunity to join a party of trappers
bound for the Yellowstone and seized
it eagerly. He was willing to retrace
his steps Into the wilderness to the
west on the chance of meeting Henry's
party and the intended victims of his
revenge.
Again fate played a strange trick.
When the party were nearing the Man
dan villages on the Missouri, Glass de
cided that he could save some time by
going overland across a big bend in the
river to Hilton's fort, a trading post.
Still possessed of the one overwhelm
ing desire for revenge, he struck out
alone. By doing so he saved his life
once more, for the neat day the Ari
cara Indians attacked the party he had
left and killed every man.
Seen by Squaws
As Glass neared Tilton 's fort, he
saw two squaws in the brush and rec
ognized them as Aricaras. He tried to
hide, but too late, for the women had
seen him and at once notifies their

he set out once more up the river.

buffalo calves at this season were very
young, and as they were plentiful he
had all the meat he needed, for it was
comparatively easy to catch them. In

reached Fort Atkinson in June. Here
he found one of his faithless comrades,

that to do so meant immédiate trial

the Indian country was swift and cer

Meteorite Mountain in Arizona
Meteorites nearly always take the
name of the town nearest which thev
fall. Out in Arizona, near Canyon
Diablo, is Meteorite mountain, and sci
entists expect that eventually there
will be uncovered there the largest
meteorite that ever struck the earth.
(This so-called mountain is really a

of
feet in height, rising from a plain. It
is 10 miles south of Canyon Diablo

METEORITES GOOD AS GOLD.
Chance, to Get Rich When Shootln<
Star Showers Come Upon
the Earth.
If any one is so lucky as to find one
of the shooting stars in the meteoric
showers, he may congratulate himself
on having captured a prize worth its
weight in gold. The number of col
lectors of meteorites is increasing, and
the competition between the duff er.-nt
cabinets, public and private, has caused
a great advance in the price of rare
specimens.
The largest and finest collection of
meteorites on this side of the Atlantic
is the one in the Harvard Mineralogical
museum in Cambridge. Reckoning
European collections it ranks about
fifth or sixth in the world. The Brit
ish museum has the best collection, as
it has of so many other filings. and the
cabinets in Vienna and Paris rank
next, says the New York Sun.
Calculating the comparative value of
collections of meteorites is something
of an art. A main point to be taken
into consideration is the number of
""falls.” so called, which are represent
ed. Ordinarily, perhaps, each meteoric
mass which is found represents a sep
arate fall; but often a meteorite splits
into several pieces, falling 50 or 100
miles distant from one another on
striking the earth's atmosphere. The
common origin of such pieces is often
demonstrated by analysis or by general
appearance, but more often, perhaps,
it remains in doubt.
About 275 falls are represented at
Harvard, with a total weight—another
factor in estimating comparative value
—of about 2.800 pounds. The largest
meteorite known is the famous one dis
covered by Peary in Greenland. The
largest meteorite in the Cambridge
collection weighs 1,100 pounds. But
the largest meteorite is not necessarily
the most valuable. Much depends on
the matter of ""control.” A very large
and famous meteorite is Canon Diablo,
so called in accordance with the recog
nized rule for naming meteorites, from
the locality in Arizona where it was
found. Here great pieces of a t housand
pounds or more can be obtained by any
one who wants them for the trouble
and expense at carting them away. In
other words, no one controls it. and it
has little or no money value. On the
other hand, a much smaller and less
interesting meteorite owned wholly
or mainly by a single cabinet is likely to
be worth hundreds of dollars. A single
small piece of some notable meteorite
thus held may easily be vilu d. forex
ample, at the rate of $75 or $lOO a pound.
The pound, indeed, is much too clumsy
a standard for so vahtab'.e a material
as meteorite stone or iron, and the
weight of all specimens is recorded! in
the catalogues in grammes.
In ancient times and among savage
tribes meteorites have been
looked upon with more or less awe,
and have often been objects of p orship.
The Palladium which fell at Troy, for
example, was doubtless a meteorite.
In three small meteorites discovered
by the Peabody museum on altars
raised by the mound builders of the
Little Miami valley in Ohio. Harvard
possesses the only authentic prehis
toric examples known to exist. Such
archaeological or historical interest
naturally adds much to the market
value of a meteorite. A well-known
American collector recently secured
from the shah of Persia a number of
pieces from a famous semi-sacred
meteorite which had been in the pos
session of the royal family for genera
tions, and by disposing of bits to va
rious European museums on his way
home, was able, he said, to pay all the
expenses of his trip to Teheran.
The earliest American fall record, d
is Campo del Cielo, from the Argentine
republic, 1783; and the first in the
United States is the Weston, Connecti
cut, 1807.

SAN ANTONIO DAILY LIGHT, SAN ANTONIO. TEXAS, DEC. 8, 1900.
BOOSIEO_MTONIO.
HON. JOHN M. LITTLE TOSSED
BOUQUETS THIS WAY.
Text of Hie Address to the Induetrial
Convention at New Orleane Yester
day—Some Truths.
The following is the address of Hon.
John M. Little, delegate from San An
tonio to the Southern Industrial con
vention at New Orleans, delivered there
yesterday:
""Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:
I take great pride in telling you of the
largest and wealthiest city in the state
and feel sure that you can listen to her
history and never grow weary, for in
its centre stands, as a monument to
the past, the sacred Alamo, whose an
walls can more vividly portray
than words express, the thrilling history
of Texas freedom.
""From the ashes of those who died as
martyrs to liberty, sprang up the beauti
ful city ""vf San Antonio and her plazas
and parks, from which can be gathered
at any season the richest ami rarest
flowers, and her magnificent buildings
tell the true story of her progress.
""Upon one of our monuments is the
inscription: ""Who will follow old Ben
Milam into San Antonio!’ In an instant
arose the assembling voices of 400 brave
Texans who knew no defeat. Though
Milam fell while leading them to victory
his voice still re-echoes and men have
continued to follow until we now have
the largest, wealthiest and most enter
prising city in the state.
“Our surrounding country, by the
neaeeful invasion of ‘the man with the
hoe,’ is lieing rapidly transformed from
plain to farm. The orchard is to be seen
where tne mesquite once grew, and corn
and cotton take the place of the cacti.
Indeed is the city of which 1 have told
you the ‘Golden Gate' of Southwest
Texas.
""From a geographical position South
and Southwest Texas, with San Antonio
as its business center, is destined to be
one of the leading commercial ]>oints of
the south. Lying south within five hours
run of the Gulf of Mexico. West, at our
very door, with nothing but the Rio
Grande to separate us, is the republic
of Mexico, to which country we export
a great many products of onr own make.
A most cordial feeling exists between
the state of Texas and our neighbor re
public, and the at our
annual fair were interesting and praise
worthy. With the friendly relations
now existing betwen us, and the con
tinuation of the wise and enterprising
policy of the Mexican government, we
are doubly assured of incalculable bene
fits vet to follow.
SAN ANTONIO AS A HEALTH RE
SORT.
""As a health resort San Antonio can
never be excelled. It has an elevation
of about 700 feet above the sea level.
At, this altitude* the air pure, warm
ayidry, and especially’ conducive to the
lieaTiTtg of consumptives and asthmatics.
The average sunshiny days is nearly
two-thirds of the year, and the tem
perature of the weather rarely approach
es either extreme.
""The city is supplied with pure spring
water obtained from the source of the
San Antonio river.
""Our sulphur wells are attractions in
which we take pride. Excellent street
car service has been provided to one of
the wells, with the best accommodations
for your comfort while there. Diseases
that our climate cannot cure our sulphur
water will.
""We have our places of amusement for
the entertainment of our visitors, and
the plazas and parks for their relation.
Our natural and artificial inducements
coupled together have made San Antonio
renowned as a sanitarium.
GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS.
""San Antonio has a population, includ
ing the suburbs, of 05,000. being the larg
est city in the state. The official asses
sed valuation of Bexar county, of which
San Antonio is the county seat, is
$35,183,000. making it the wealthiest
county in the state. The comptroller’s
report shows that Bexar county values
have increased during the past year
$1,872,070, this being the largest increase
of any county.
""Our municipal government is in an
excellent condition. Our business men
have been working hand in hand with
the city administration with the sole
end in view of making the Alamo City
the pride of the west. In this they have
succeeded. Most of our streets are pav
ed, and $400,000 is now being prudently
expended in street improvements. When
this amount shall have hpen expended,
then we will have the best improved city
of its size in the south. It may be that
Louisiana is partly responsible for these
improvements, for our mayor, Hon.
Marshal Hicks, was imported from this
state. Out sewer system is now com
plete, and the city placed in an excel
lent sanitary condition. ‘Be sanitary
and be sane,' is our motto.
""We have seven large banking institu
tions; seven large hotels, and numerous
boarding houses, clinging reasonable
rates for board: twenty-one colleges and
private schools, and sixteen public
schools. In these institutions of learn
ing the pupils not only' receive anental
training, but special attention is paid to
their moral development. We have also
eleven large wholesale houses; sixteen
halls and club houses; one large market
house and convention hall with a seating
capacity of 5000; 129 secret societies
anil musical organizations; four orphan
asylums; sixty-two places of worship;
two rescue homes; 103 manufacturing
plants; and two packing houses. To this
is to be added the Southwestern Insane
asylum, and the famous military post,
Fort Sani Houston.
RAILROAD CENTER.
“San Antonio is also a railroad center.
We have four railroads through the city,
with two others already under construc
tion, one of which is the Missouri, Kan
sas & Texas. These railways connect
us directly with the two oceans and the
Gulf of Mexico. We are directly in
touch with all the leading commercial
cities of the United States and Mexico.
LIVE STOCK, COTTON AND WOOL.
“The tenth census statistics show that
Texas had at that time more than 4,000.-
00 head of cattle, which was nearly
3,000,000 more than any other state or
territory in the United States. Most
of these cattle were raised in South and
West Texas. The sheep industry is also
a very important one, and the city of
San Antonio is the largest primary wool

did me but little good.
« Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound has been recommended

“ I write this letter with the hope of hearing from you in regard
to my case.” — Mus. S. J. Watson, Hampton, Va.
» November 27, 1899.,
“ Dear Mrs. Pinkham: — I feel it my duty to acknowledge to
you the benefit that your advice and Lydia E. Pinkham s X egetable
Compound have done for me.
“ I had been suffering with female troubles for some time, could
walk but a short distance, had terrible bearing down pains in lower
part of my bowels, backache, and pain in ovary. I used your medicine
for four months and was so much better that I could walk three times
the distance that I could before.
“ I am to-day in better health than I have been for more than
two years, and 1 know it is all due to Lydia E. Pinkham s X egetable
Compound.
« I recommend your advice and medicine to all women who suffer. 9

“Texas ranks first as a cotton growing
state. Our reports show that more than
3,000,000 bales were raised in 1899. and
notwithstanding the storms and over
flows during the year, our crop bids fair
to be in excess of last years. Cottony
alone will bring to Texas this year more
than $27,00!),000. Only within the last
few years have the people of Southwest
Texas directed their attention to cotton
raising, but it has proven a great suc
cess. The land will average this year
from three-fourths to one and one-half
bales per acre.
MINERALS.
""Oil has been discovered within five or
six miles of San Antonio, and stock
companies are rapidly preparing to de

it as their opinion, after investigation,
that oil will be discovered in large quan
tities. Asphalt, iron, and coal have been
discovered in large quantities. Copper
and silver have also been found along
the Hio Grande.
MANUFACTORIES.
‘.’Experience has taught us that there
are certain primary conditionsUiecessury
for the success of any factory. I he first
of these conditions, as is given in Tomp
kins' ’Cotton Mill Commercial Features.’
is its location. The factory must be so
placed as to assure the health of the em
ployes. Second, a cotton or woolen mill,
and the same rule is applicable to all.
must be located in a cotton and wool
raising country. Third, freight rates,
fuel, water supply and taxation are to
be considered. There not a section
of country in the United States whose
climate will compare with ours. Texas
raises more cotton and w 00l than any
other state in the union. Our freight
rates are governed by a commission, and
Qur fuel and water supply are to be had
at our verv door. Our rate of taxation
is very low, and with our increasing
revenue we are assured that it will re
main so.
HOMESEEKERS. - /
""To those in quest of homes I would
point them to the west, for there op
portunities await them not to be found
elsewhere. Good land can be bought at
frqm $1 to s2p per acre, depending upon
' the location, and that upon easy terms
| of payment. School lands can be bought
' bv the section, consisting of 640 acres,
I at from $1 to $4 per acre, depending
| upon its classification. Forty years is'
i given upon in which to pay for it, at so
much annually with a three per cent,
rate of interest. The report of the land
I commissioner for the fiscal year ending
September 1. 1900, shows that there
are 20,013,527 acres belonging to the
school fund. The greatest portion of
this land is situated in the Western por
tion of the state, and can be bought or
leased from the state. Every man that
wants a home can secure it on terms to
suit himself. These are the inducements
we offer to the homeseeker, which we
believe are most liberal.""

The success of the Garrisons bears'
some local interest. They were in San
Antonio about eight years ago doing a
turn at the old Bella Union theatre,
then under the sensational management
of George Clayton. During the excite
ment over the Whitechapel outrages Mr.
Garrison put on a production here en
titled “Jack the Ripper,” and with it
packed the Bella Union to the doors.
All that remains of this playhouse now
is a piece of ground on South Laredo

WREN A METEORITE FALLS
No Record of Human Beings Harmed
by Stones From Space.
RECENT FALL IN GEORGIA RECALLED
Theory Is That Meteorites Are Dispersed
Matter from Shattered Plan
ets-r-Moat*,Meteors Fall In. May and
June. .. . . ..
""/The-fall bf ;a meteorite on a negro
farm near PittS, Ga., gives further evidence
-of a peculiar record of these
phfenomenai -Several negroes were
wbrklng.mear the place the different
fragments lodged, but were uninjured.
SCHfaf aB; is ""known no human- being
has ever been 'harmed by these -stones,
though-^attle have been killed by them.
There Is a;record of a meteoric stone
falling through the roof of a peasant's
nouse in nungary iniu me rvum nucic
two children were asleep. The children
were covered with debris, but
wore uninjured. .
The ""Pitts meteorite fell on the morning
of April 20 and was visible over an
area of several thousand square miles.
S. W. McCallie, Georgia's state geologist,
gives the following account of it
in the Atlanta Constitution:
The attendant phenomena witnessed,
by the observers of the Pitts meteorite
were similar in character and succeeded
each other in the same order as
that noted in"" meteoric falls in general.
Named in order of their occurrence,
they* were: 1 A ""rapidly moving body,
often referred to as a Are ball; a dense
smdke'in the wake of the Are ball; occasionally
luminous for several ^minutes;
distinct... . .boomings,; generally
compared to. discharge of distant cannon,
succeeded by a number of lesser
sounds; a roaring or whizzing noise
not unlike the sound of a falling body
and its impact on the surface of the
earth. .
Sounds Like Thunder.
The Arst sound heard ""was compared
to that of thunder, and to many it
was the Arst warning that any unusual
. occurrence was taking place in
the sky above. At Cordele, 15 miles
west of Pitts, the sound resembled that
ofia-heavy explosion, distinctly heard
by-several, people on the street. In the
country,- ' four miles fedst of Cordele,
nvntnolntic U'Orfl TlfltPf?
twu ^Oijl OA|/iVOtvi?o *? V4 V
loydpr.-tKirv tKiinder, whJch so terrified
th^rf arjrp tlands that they ran frighte
jUd?-'to tSfetrl liprnes. In the immediate
ylpjhhty qf',^ the sound was desoflbedy^Jifc
several . loud explosions,
cabbing., the-cjayth to tremble, followed
itV^uick buccebblon by a number of
lesser explosions.
The roaring, arid whizzing noise and
the impact of. the falling fragments
we're heard only in the immediate vicinity
of the fall.
An explanation of the different phenomena
above given are as follows:
Thja rapidly moving ball of fire was the
meteorite itself made self-luminous by
the friction produced in passing
through the upper atmosphere. The
speed of meteorites when they first encounter
the earth'B atmosphere is said
tp be seven to forty miles a second.
The smoke is fused particles of the
meteorite brushed off from its surface
as It moves rapidly through the air.
The sound compared to the booming of
cannon and also the lesser sounds are
supposed to be due to the explosion of
the meteorite and the sudden beating
of the surrounding air. The retardation
of the meteorite by the resistance
of air exerts a powerful disruptive force
upon it. since the rear part of the meteorite
tends to travel with the planetary
speed while the forward part is
being checked. The whizzing and roaring
noise heard some minutes after the
Irttirl ovnlnqinn was DrodUCed by til C
fragments of the. meteorite passing
through the air. This sound was followed
immediately by the impact of
the falling fragment striking the earth.
Fell Near a House. .
The largest pieces, weighing 57
ounces, fell within less than 75 feet of
Nancy Brinson's house, where it was
dug up a few minutes later still warm,
but not red hot as first reported. The
fragments entered the freshly plowed
sandy soil to a depth of about 16
inches, formirig an inconspicuous hole
less than 18 inches in diameter and
scarcely half so deep. The fragment Is
irregular, rhomboidal in shape. More
than two-thirds of the surface shows
the natural pitted characteristics of an
iron meteorite coated with black iron
oxide through which in places are to
be seen patches of silvery white nickel
iron. The remaining parts of the surface
are rough and angular with more
or less sharp projecting points showing
evidence of rupture from other
fragments. This surface is more or
less smoked, but it has not the thick
coating of the other surface.- This
fragment is made up largely of nickel
?.u:Aw ;n i rrop-nla r

masses, occurs the stony material. The
latter consists mainly of gray mineral
interspersed with occasional greenish
1 granules.
1 ' A second fragment fell by the-road'
1 side within a.hundred feet of Jim Harden's
house, which is 700 feet southeast
of .the Brinson .house, and within
three feet of a negro boy .who was
walking along the road.
No ""Foreign"" Elements.
It might be interesting to the readei
t to know that up to the present no ele1
ments have been found in meteorites
' that have not been found on the earth
1 This would seem to indicate that likely
all celestial bodies are made up oi
the same material as the earth, anc
that all have a common origin,
e Prior to the 18th century the fall* o
meteorites was not accredited by scifi
entists, although numerous instance!
o were recorded. Plutarch tells of th<
g fall of a. stone in Thrace, in 470 R. C.
The most generally accepted theorj
? r: 'v ' - -'
is the meteorites are dispersed matter
from shattered planets, or satellites,
although more study Is needed before
a satisfactory decision as to their origin
can be reached.
May and June seem to be the months
in which the greatest number of meteorites
fall. Fifteen to twenty million
are said to fall daily, but comparatively
few*are of sufficient size to be seen
by the naked eye.

It will have to do differently.
Why, on the plains, when we wiped

Says Animals Have Souls
""In reading the Bible it has interested
me to see the animal life in it.
When you come to look at it, Noah
wns really just a caretaker of the animals
in the ark. Even the whale
must have been disgusted with Jonah.
And as for Balaam's ass, he certainly
had more spiritual vision than Balaam
or he never would have seen that angel
in the middle of the road. Some
day when we have learned what the
ass said to Balaam we will have new
vision.# . ...
""I believe that the splfit jbf departed
animais have much to--do with man's
present state of unrest and anxiety. I
cannot think that the great Creator
gave anything life without a soul to
continue its existence in another
world. And even if I did believe that
animals do not have a future life, I
should be all the kinder .to>' them in
their hrief existence on this earth.""
? Rev. Dr. J. S. Moffatt.has resigned

has been friction in'the college for several
years. In order to furnish the opportunity
for a settlement. Dr. Moffatt
placed his resignation in the hands of

smooth matters over, by making Dr.
Moffatt president emeritus. This
would have separated him from any
connection with the executive management
and put him in the field ca'nvassing

The doctor, however, has declined the

STUDIES IN
NATURAL HISTORY
| By JAMES HENRY RICE, Jr.
THE RUSTY BLACKBIRD.
Order?Passeres; Genus, Euphagus;
Family, Icteridae; Species, Carolinus.
The generic-' jiame,- Euphagus, was
coined by some blunderer to mean
""good devourer,"" (Greek, phagein, to
dp.vour, and eu, well or good); from
the bird's voracity, as well the specific:
name, carolinus (or Carolina, showing
the type specimen, came from
South Carolina), wholly- oblivious of
J.he Latin rule that names of birds
and trees are feminie. The proper adaptive
is carolinensis.
i The Rusty Blackbird has a. wide
range, extended to the north to the
Kowak river, Alaska, northern Mackenzie
and central Keewatin, which is
the breeding zone, extends south to
New York, New Hampshire and northern
Maine. The range, in migration,
extends west to the plains and it winters
south of the Ohio and Delaware
rivers to the Gulf coast. It has occurred
accidental in Lower California,
California and Greenland.
Description of Blackbird
Ridgway thus describes the bird:
""Bill slender, shorter than the head:
about equal to the hind toe; fits height
not quite two-fifths the total length.
Wing nearly an inch longer than the
tail; second qijUl longest: first a little
shorter"" than the fourth. Tail
sljghtly graduated: the lateral feathers
about a quarter of an inch shortest.
General color black with purple reflections;
the wings, under tail-coverts
and hinder part of the belly, glossed,'with
green. In autumn the feathers
largely edged with ferruginous or
brownish, so as to change the appearance
entirely. Spring female dull
.opaque plumbeous or ashe-black; the
wings and toil sometimes with a green
lustre, The young like the autumnal
birds. Length of male, 9.50?female
smaller (""Hist. Bird of North America""?Baird,
Brewer and Ridgway).
: As the Rusty Blackbird is a visitant
throughout most of the United States
.and its breeding zone ultralimital, our
naturalists are unacquainted with its
nesting habits, except those who have
visited the far .interior of-Canada and
Alaska: for breeding records in the
southern, limit of the breeding zone
.arc rare.""
Build Nesf on the Ground.
: .A report quoted by Oliver Davie
(Nests and Eggs of American Birds)
states that the nest is placed on the
ground like that of the Savannah
.sparrow and is built of hair and fibres.
Mr. John W. Banks found a, nest and
.eggs (two eggs and two young in nest)
flear St. John, New Brunswick. This
was in a spruce tree, twenty-eight
feet above the ground. The nest was
-omposed chiefly of honeysuckle vines.
JTiixea wnn rorrrung a, suuu uiaw.
The eggs were'described as varying
from grayish to light green, thickly
covered with blotches and dottlngs of
purplish and reddish-brown, without
streaks and linrjft' usually three to four
'n number. Another report makes the
maximum number of eggs seven.

Wayne's earliest record is October,

The birds become abundant by iVovember,
and they begin moulting the i

according to the same authority

Here is seen a wonder and a mystery
of nature's fashioning. Two
birds, almost alike, and both known
locally as ""blackbirds,"" associate. One
is almost a native; the other a visitant
from lands unknown to our people,
except from reports of travelers
and books. Very often indeed does
the naturalist, while studying familiar
objects, come upon facts that are
strange and startling, the explanation
of which lies beyond the bounds of
knowledge. Why one bird should nest

Recovered Is Sent to Smithsonian
Scientists have made the first
recovery of a meteorite in a
""virtually uncontaminated’’
state, the Smithsonian Institu
tion announced today,
The 18% -pound meteorite
was recovered May 20 after
blazing across the sky and
crashing into a sandy ridge
near Harleton, Tex., E. P. Hen
derson. associate curator at the
Smithsonian, said.
He said all other recoveries
of meteorites have been made
too late for testing and analyz
ing the meteorites’ elements be
fore they were broken down by
the earth’s atmosphere.
The meteorite was cut in
half at the Smithsonian today.
Next week, American and Rus
sian meteorologists will begin
testing portions of the meteor
ite, the first known to fall in
the United States since Octo
ber, 1959.
Content to Be Studied
They will attempt to ascer
tain something of the content
and structure of matter out
side the earth’s atmosphere.
Previous finds had deterio
rated to such an extent that
their testing by scientists pro
vided little or no information
about their origination or
flight, Mr. Henderson said.
He said last month’s me
teorite was observed by a young
boy as it began burning when
it entered the earth’s atmos
phere.
The boy’s father, J. J. Carver
of Harleton, made the recovery
after his son led him to the
area where the meteorite
crashed in the sand, according
to Mr. Henderson. (
Found in 10 Minutes
“The meteorite was located
within a matter of 10 minutes,
buried in a small sand crater
about 25 to 30 inches deep,”
Mr. Henderson said.
“The fast recovery and care
ful handling of the rock will
enable meteorologists to study
the rock while it’s still free
from terrestial contamination.
“Usually, people try to do
foolish tricks with meteorites—
they pour acid on them, heat
them or try to crack them open.
“Within 20 hours of the
time it fell, Oscar Monnig of
Fort Worth had acquired the
meteorite for us.”
Meteorite tests and measure
ment have to be made within
30 days to obtain accurate in
formation. he said.
“After 30 days, the elements
deteriorate and their evalua
tion would give us distorted in
formation,” Mr. Henderson
said.
Chunks Being Distributed
Chunks of half of the mete
orite will be sent to six labora
tories across the country and
to Russia, he said. Hie testing
is expected to begin next week.
The laboratories in this coun
try include Brookhaven in
Long Island, New York; Astro
physical in Cambridge, Mass.;
the Carnegie Institution, Pitts
burgh, Pa.; the University of
Southern California; the Uni
versity of Chicago, and the
University of Kentucky.
The Smithsonian’s Building
of Natural History will retain
the second half of the meteor
ite, Mr. Henderson said.
He described the complete
meteorite as 9 inches long, and
6 inches in width and breadth.
Mr. Henderson said the rock
contains some nickel, iron and
iron sulfites and has a black
crust.
It was named the Harleton
Meteorite after the geographic
location of its discovery. Harle
ton is about 40 miles 'west of
Shreveport, La.

Social Security
Changes Win
Committee OK
The Senate Finance Commit
tee today approved the House
social security bill, liberalizing
old-age and disability retire
ment benefits.
The most important change
would give men the option al
ready held by women of retiring
at 62, instead of 65, on a re
duced annuity.
The Senate committee added
two amendments not related to
the social security system. One,
by Senator Russell Long, Dem
ocrat of Louisiana, would raise
the ceiling on the amount of
State relief checks toward which
the Federal Government con
tributes from |65 to $67.50 a
month.
The second amendment, of
fered for the administration by
Senator Smathers, Democrat of
Florida, would authorize the
Secretary of Health, Education
and Welfare to provide tempo
rary financial help to American
citizens who have been forced
to return from Cuba and are
in need.
Backs Permanent Setup
These Americans and many
Cuban refugees have been pro
vided for temporarily out of a
presidential emergency fund.
But this amendment would give
permanent authority to take
care of American refugees who
may return from any country
because of a threat of war or
similar crisis.
Officials estimate that about
$300,000 would be needed in the
coming year to take care of
Americans forced to leave Cuba
until they get on their feet
financially.
The optional retirement pro
vision is expected to benefit
men in depressed areas whose
jobs have been abolished by
modern technology.
Other proposed changes in
the law would: .
Increase from $33 to S4O the
minimum monthly retirement
benefit for those who retire at
or after 65. ,
Liberalize the length of time
a person must work to acquire
insured status.
Would Aid Widows
Increase the benefits of wid
ows and other survivors of an
annuitant.
These increased benefits
would be financed by an in
crease in the payroll tax in
January from 3 to 3% per cent
each on employer and employe,
with a corresponding small in
crease in the tax on self
employed.
Senate r Long’s increased
Federal payment to relief re
cipients would be limited to
one year and would cost about
S2O million if all the States
take advantage of it.
The Federal Government
pays 80 per cent of the first
S3O of a relief check, and under
this amendment would pay
from 50 to 65 per cent of the
next $37.50, depending on the
per capita income of the State.
The committee turned down
three motions by Serjator Hart
ke. Democrat of Indiana, one
of which would have allowed
retired persons to earn up to
SI,BOO a year without any de
duction from their social se
curity benefit.
The committee also turned
down a move by Senator
Smathers to allow a child to
receive social security bene
fits as a dependent until age
21 if he or she were still in
school.

Rules Unit Puts Off
Vote on Housing Bill
Democratic leadership plans
for House debate on*a housing
bill next week became uncertain
today when the Rules Commit
tee announced It would not
start voting on the measure
before next Tuesday.
Sponsors of the legislation
said this was not necessarily a
bad sign. They interpreted it
as a possible indication that the
sessions would not be dragged
out, as has happened in the
past, to delay action.
Committee Chairman Smith,
Democrat of Virginia, said the
arrangement decided on today
at a closed session following the
first open hearing on the bill
did not constitute any commit
ment to vote Tuesday or any
other day. He said the com
mittee will resume hearings
Monday.
Clearance Appears Sure
Eventual clearance of the
bill seemed assured despite op
position by all five Republican
members and a few Democratic
members of the enlarged Rules
Committee.
Today’s hearing had only one
witness, Representative Rains,
Democrat of Alabama, the
Banking and Currency Com
mittee member in charge of the
$4.9 billion bill. He took much
of the opening session to ex
plain the complicated measure
containing most of President
Kennedy’s proposals for hous
ing legislation this year.

French Will Act
On 200 in Revolt
PARIS, June 15 (AP).—Pres
ident de Gaulle’s government
plans action against some 200
French officers as a result of
the military revolt in Algeria
last April.
Defense Minister Pierre
Messmer told the Defense Com
mittee yesterday that about 100
officers are marked for legal
proceedings and another 100
or so will be discharged from
the service.
He assured the committee
that the government would
move carefully to avoid any
thing like the widespread purge
of 1945, when many officers
were discharged on suspicion
of having collaborated with
the Germans.
Mr. Messmer said discharged
officers would retain their pen
sion rights and receive in
demnities.
Three generals have been
stripped of their rank and sen
tenced to 15 years in prison
each for their part in the revolt.

-ulrty years' experience In connec

of such phenomena, has gono a long
way toward making mo a heretic, and
has quite unfitted me for duties in
which tho credibility of human testi
mony is involved,"" said Dr. George
P. Merrll, head curator of tho depart
ment of geology at tho Smithsonian
Institution at Washington tho other
day.
""This -department is constantly re
ceiving letters from people all over
the United States who havo actually
seen' a meteorite fall and want infor
mation in regard to it. Samples of
these which have been sent on for
examination usually prove to be noth

metallic iron, granite, etc.
""The number of persona actually
finding authentic meteorites is hardly
greater than 1 per cent, of the entire
number. This may perhaps be caused
by the low angle of incidence charac
teristic of the fall of many meteorites,
but It is a fact that even tho most
experienced of observers havo been
mistaken, and stones 'actually seen,
to .strike tho earth in nearby fields
have been ultimately found even miles
away.

there is no authentic"" record of a
meteorite ever having done any dam

scarcely more than that duo to gra

""Since I have been connected with

cases of the supposed finding of me
teorites have come under my notice
One of tho most startling Instances of
the fall of a meteorite was chronicled.
in a reliable newspaper not long ago,
""The 'meteorite, which was reported
to be 'immense,' it was said, 'exploded
with a loud report when within 100
feet of the ground. The windows of
the place rattled and there was a
bhower of splintered Iron on tne rooi.
The country was lighted up for miles
and people were terrorized.' Seeing
the report of this, an investigation
was at once begun by writing to peo
ple living In the vicinity of where the
phenomena had occurred.
""In reply a letter was received from
a man to whom the matter had been
referred, and who had been recom
mended to me as ;a man of reputa

points brought out In the newspaper

In regard to its color, shape, etc.
""Further Investigations of the mat
ter were undertaken, with a view of
obtaining if possible, a specimen of
the meteorite. None was found how
ever, but it was .discovered that tho
occasion chronicled had been caused
by the 'explosion of some dynamite
which the boys of the neighborhood
had stolen.
Some ""Strange""-StorIes.
""Another newspaper clipping which
came under my notlco reported that a
man had been hit by a meteorite. It
stated that it struck him 'so terrible
a blow that he was found senseless
near his home with a crushed and
fractured skull.' In describing the
stone the article went on to state,
that it was 'the size of an orange,
strangely corrugated, and marked
with wjdmanstatten or peculiar cry
stalline figures. Mineralogists who
saw it declare it is unquestionably
of meteoric origin.'
""The article also went on to state
that tho man's condition was critical,
and that ho had been removed to a
hospital. Correspondence with the
postmaster of the city In which the
accident took place was entered into.
He in turn communicated with the
physician attending the injured man,
Who made the statement that tho ob
stacle which had struck tho man was
an ordinary stone thrown by a neigh

Once upon a time, a man who was too economical to take
a paper, sent his little boy to borrow the copy taken by his
neighbors. In his haste, the boy ran over a four dollar stand of
bees, and in ten minutes looked like a watery summer squash.
His cries reached his father, who ran to his assistance,
and, failing to see a barb-wire fence, ran into it, breaking it
down, cutting a handful of flesh from his anatomy and ruining
a five-dollar pair of pants.
The old cow took advantage of the gap in the fence, got
into the cornfield and killed herself eating green corn. Hearing
the racket, his wife ran, upsetting a four-gallon churn full of
rich cream into a basket of kittens, drowning the whole ""flock.""
In her hurry she dropped a seven-dollar set of teeth. The baby,
left alone, crawled through the spilled milk into the parlor and
ruined a twenty-dollar carpet, During the excitement the oldest
daughter ran away with the hired man, the calves got out and '
the dog broke up eleven sitting hens.

HEALTH OF THE ARMY. v
The Medical Department Has Suc
ceeded In Eradicating One of the
Moat Deadly of Diseaaea.
The strenuous efforts of the medical
department of the army have resulted
apparently in the practical eradication
of that trying disease, dysentery,
which has caused the American troops
in the Philippines so much suffering
and so many deaths, says a Washing
ton report. During the campaigning
in the Philippines, as has been the case
in every war, hundreds of men have
died from this disease, and others have
been discharged because of total dis
ability. Dysentery is more prevalent
and severe in the Philippines than in
this country, but the enforcement of
strict sanitary measures, including the
boiling of all drinking water, rules for
bathing and especially the washing of
the hands before handling food, has
caused the disease almost to disap
pear.
The ""adobe itch,"" another disease
which caused the army great annoy
ance, has also been successfully dealt
with. While this disease is not fatal,
it attacks men, women and children
alike. Microscopic examinations and
study of this disease developed that it
was caused by a parasite, as in dysen
tery, and it appeared that it was com
municated by the careless methods em
ployed bj' the Chinese in doing laundry
work. They were in the habit of dry
ing the clothes by spreading them
bushes and on the grass, and ironing
them with a cold iron. Under the be
lief that the parasite came from the
vegetation, and was communicated to
the clothes from the bushes, orders
were issued that the clothes would be
hung on lines to dry, and ironed with
hot irons instead of cold. As a result
of this practice the disease disap
peared.
According to reports received by
Surgeon General Forward, typhoid
fever is on the decrease in the Philip
pines, and when the heav
on
y rams come
a complete eradication of this dis
ease is expected.

what he went after.—a very'

$50,000 being appropriated for this

Prof. Ward here gave a very inter
esting account of his expedition in
search of the mammoth meteorite.
The first thing he did was to hunt
tip a
photographer to accompany him. and
this matter gave him some difficulty,
since he was afraid he might not find
any one in Mexico willing to undertake
the expedition. But after finding his
man arrangements were quickly made.
They made the journey partly by
rail, then along the seacoast and the
volcanic region, disembarking
Colima and traveling by mule around
the volcanic mountain of Colima. He
described this volcano
at
as emitting
sudden and silent explosions of vapor
which rise in the air like a flower. He
traveled about 95 miles-from thecoast.
and finally found the meteorite about
which so many rumors had reached
the scientific ear, some declaring it
was as large as a ship. It was found
in a cultivated cornfield.
Prof. Ward engaged some 28 Mexi
cans to dig it out for him, paying them
75 cents a day, which
regular wages. It took them« day and

J. P. STAHL, Proprietor.
The recent election in Oregon shows
large gains (or the populists. One pop
ulist congressman is elected and probab
ly the other. The Republicans claim
tbe legislature and the next United
States senator, but the result is stiU in
doubt. In many districts the pops and
democrats combined.
President (Jrover is receiving consid
erable snubbing from congress just at
present, not altogether complimentary
.to the two houses which are doing the
•ose twisting act, but a snubbing just
the same. The passage of the river and
karbor appropriation bill over the presi
dent's veto is something at which he
m*y smile, as it is a piece of unwar
ranted extravagance in the present con
dition of the treasury. But the republi
cans would probably rather appropriate
that oioney now than at tbe next see
•ion when the administration is repub
lican, so that in the future the compar
ison between republican and democratic
expenditures may be favorable to the
former. This is not the highest kind of
statesmanship nor yet very creditable as
a business proposition. But the full
absurdity of tbe situation is brought
out when, after making such exorbitant
appropriations as cannot be met by rev
enues now running four millions per
mouth short, congress should past a bill
prohibiting the administration from is
suing any more bonds without further
authority from congress. Were the re
publicans wholly, responsible for this
bill it might be said they were getting
the president in a corner where it would
be necessary for him to sign a protective
tariff till in order to get out. In the sen
ate where the bill passed only 10 repub
licans voted for it while 17 democrats
and ul 1 the populists did. Against tbe
bill were 10 republicans and only U dem
ocrats total votes 32 to £3. Tbe bill in
its entirety reads:
""Be it enacted, that issuance of inter
est-bearing bonds of the United States,
for any purpose whatever, without fur
ther authority of congress is hereby pro
hibited.""

land Stone.
TOPEKA, Kan., June 4.—A local paper
says it is possible that there is an object
that does not appear upon the surface
for the sudden departure for Alaska of
Professor L. L. Dyche of the Kansas
state university. During his northern
trip last summer, the professor paid a
visit, while in Greenland, to the largest
meteorite in the world, and imme
diately announced his determination to
possess it. Lieutenant Peary, however,
claimed the meteorite by right of dis
covery, and warned tbe professor not to
remove it. As the meteorite weighs
dozens of tons, Peary's warning was of
necessity heeded at the time, but Pro
fessor Dyche stated distinctly that he
intended within a few years to return
to Greenland for the meteorite. Last
week the dispatches announced that
Lieutenant Peary would sail for Green
land this summer to secure the meteor
ite. As soon as Professor Dyche can
reach Seattle, he too will sail for the
North, and it is quite probable that his
destination is neither Alaska, nor tho
north pole, but the point in Greenland
where the coveted meteorite lies.
The meteorite is roughly estimated to
be worth $50,000.

WASHINGTON, June 4.—The practical
workings of a profit sharing scheme, as
applied to a great paper making busi
ness in Grimma, Saxony, are set out in
detail by United States Consul Mono

BERNE, June 4.—The national council
ha* expressed regret that the United

The president of the confederation, M.

PROSPECTS OF SILVER.
Figures Showing Strength of White Metal
at Chicago.
CHICAGO, June 3.—The two-thirds
rule, heretofore governing nominations,
will be abolished by the silver majority
in the Democratic national convention.
This is the positive prediction of W. J.
Bryan, the choice of Nebraska siltfcr
Democrats for president. Mr. Bryan
himself favors the abolition of the time
honored rule, and he says that there is
no question of its being wiped out. He
bases his prediction on the assumption
that the silver men will control the con
vention. As a matter of fact, what is
assumed by the Nebraska leader on this
point is practically admitted by the gold
leaders.
Chairman Harrity and his colleagues
of the sub-committee of the Democratic
national committee—all gold men—
came to town during the morning. In
the afternoon they prepared an estimate
of how the conventian will stand, on the
money question. They gave the silver
men 427 delegates, the gold men 387,
and put 92 in the doubtful column.
Messrs. Harrity, Sherley and Wallace
were the committeemen present daring
the figuring.
Will Abolish the Two-thlrda Rale.
""The two-thirds rule ought to be
abolished and it will be abolished,"" said
Mr. Bryan while waiting in the Unity
building for an interview with Governor
Altgeld. ""A few weeks ago I oould not
have talked so positively on this point
for the reason that the certainty of our
controlling the national convention had
not materialized. Now, however, as
the struggle for keeping us from having
a majority of -the delegates has been
given up by the gold men, I can speak
more confidently. There is no doubt in
the world that the silver delegates will
have sense enough to abolish the rule.
KANSAS DEMOCRATS.
Cleveland May Be Mildly Endorsed El*
erpt aa to Finance.
TOPEKA, Kan., June 4.—The Demo­
cratic state convention assembled here
to name delegates to the Chicago con
vention was very slow in getting to
gether. A thorough canvass among the
delegates ^ems to indicate that the
delegation selected will be given iron
clad instructions for silver, and against
the single gold standard. The national
administration may receive a mild en
dorsement on Venezuela and some other
measures, but is likely to get no crumb
of comfort on the money question.
Temporary Chairman Sheridan of
Paola made a strong speech, straddling
the financial issue. He referred to
Cleveland as ""daring, intrepid, wise
and patriotic,"" and the administration
delegates smiled gleefully. When a
reference was incidentally made to free
silver, the convention fairly howled
with applause and the building trembled
from the plaudits of the white metal
lists.
During recess the permanent organi
zation was agreed oil as follows: J. R.
McCleverty, strong free silver man,
Fort Scott, chairman, W. H. Pepperell,
Concordia, secretary.
GOLD MEN WERE HISSED.
Kentucky Democrat* Have No UM IH
CarlU'e's Doctrine*.
LEXINGTON, Ky., June 4.—The Dem­
ocratic state convention was so en
thusiastically for free silver that those
of the opposite faith coald scarcely
make themselves heard. The chairman
of the state central committee, Charles
R. Long, is a follower of Cleveland and
Carlisle, and when he attempted to air
his views on finance at the opening of
the convention he was greeted by hisses
and yells, as were other speakers on
that side. On the other hand when
John R. Rhea presented the name of
Charles J. Bronstron, a silver leader,
for temporary chairman, the applause
was deafening.
After appointing the usual commit'
tees the convention recessed.

MANKATO, Minn., one 4.—A 5-year

a moment, when the horses started and
dragged him across the field, tangled up
in the lines. The boy's father was killed
by a runaway last fall.

Favorable Condition of
State Wild Fowl Reported
Helena, July 19 — <UP) —Although
much havoc has been wrought on the
great breeding grounds of ducks, geese
and other waterfowl elsewhere, the
condition in Montana is 44 very favor
able, 1 ’ according to J. W. Carney, State
Pish and Game warden.
44 At the outset, when drouth threat
ened to prevail for the year, fear was
felt for our supply of wild fowl, but
■with recent rains, the waterfowl supply
continued normal,” Carney said.
The northern part of the state seems
to be especially well-stocked, judging
from reports from game wardens, Car
ney said.
Carney attributed the apparently
plentiful supply of wild fowl in Mon
tana to the posession limit which has
been placed on hunters. The previous
limit w’as 25 per day, with no check
on possession.
44 The state's supply of fish also is
normal,” Carney said, “despite any
drouth damage. As a result of exper
ience in former years, small streams
which go dry are not planted now. Due
to this, the loss of planted fish has
decreased appreciably.''

Search Meteorite Fragments
In the BililngS Community
Billings, July 18—(ILE>_Here’s an
odd way to add a little pin money to
the family bank account—go hunting
for meteorite fragments.
The current market price for small
pieces is about SI per pound, payable
upon inspection by Prof. H. H. Nininger
i Denver, Colo.
On the trail of a great meteor that
flashed over this part of Montana last
February, Professor Nininger carried
his hunt into Billings recently.
The professor already has traced re
। ports of the huge fire-ball through Colo
rado, Utah, Montana, Wyoming. Sask
atechewan, .South Dakota, North Da
kota, Nebraska and lowa. He believes
the ball broke into three balls, two of
which fell west of Omaha, the other in
lowa.
However, although the three large
particles appear to have fallen in
Nebraska and Omaha, no trace has
been found of them. Nininger believes
smaller particles may be found in Any
of the states he mentioned.
44 If nnybody finds nny odd-looking,
heavy stones, dark-colored, irregular in
shape, with, more or less pitted or dent I
ed surfaces, he should take a fragment l
and hold it against an emery wheel,
grind it and if it is a meteorite, he will
see bright specks of nickel steel, in i
small or large particles. Or it may be
solid steel. Send a small sample to my'
laboratory and if we find it’s a genu
ine meteorite, we’ll make a price.” |
Nininger said the particles have a 1
bluish-black coat and range from size'
of a pea to that of a man’s fist.
The professor began his unique vo-1
cation eleven years ago and is allied
with the Smithsonian Institution and;
the Colorado Museum of History.
He revealed that he 4 ‘ fingerprints ” ।
each sample he obtains using a micro-'
scopic process He has found that by I
this method he can immediately iden
tify any particle as part of a new or
old meteorite, and can tell where it fell
originally.
This is necessary not only for sciem
tific reasons, but because' some times
meteoroite finders mail in their stones
from localities where meteors are rare,
hoping to get a better price. Some lo
calities, such as Arizona, abound with
fragments which have no particular

In the last 50 years only one speci

t MICKEY FINN AND
t THE BUMBLE BEE:
I By Ernest Jarrold. $
(CopTrKkt, lwo, bj boutilMUj MeQurs Co.)
r i
Kitfrtt S. I U H.i
"" ' u nrK-""i
As a delineator of lrih character Ernest
Jarrold has had but few equals. Ills ""Mick
ey Finn"" storie have been read throughout
the entire Knglih ipeakln world, and
have everywhere been popular. The late
C. A. Dana raid of them: ""They contain
the most admirable delineation of char
acter, together with a rars felicity In the
description of the woods and fields."" The
lollowlng story la taken from one of Mr.
Jarrold s books recently published by
Jamisson-Hlgglns Co., Chicago.
The sir of Cooney Island palpitated
with the fertt-Tit heat of a day in
July. The Jiot air radiated up from
the meadows and the duty road like
heat from a furnace. Even the chick
en sought the shade of friendly
trees, and the IocukIb lazily chanted
their midsummer threnody as Mickey
Finn came down Murray street with a
tattered geofrraphy, a worn kpelling
book and a thumbed firtt reader un
der his arm.
The boy's face shone from its re
cent application of soft soap and wa
ter, so that the freckles stood out
like spots of brick dubt on either side
of hit nose, lie had s stone bruise on
one of his toes, and was forced to
walk on one beel. As he limped along
the roadside, half a mile away in the
hazy perspective he could see the lit
tle red schoolhouKe in fhe hollow,
with its monotonous niptrestionn of:
""Can-the-dofr-catch-t he-cat? Ves-t he
do jf-ean-catch-t he-cat.""
In fancy he heard the dreary iter
ation of the schoolroom, and saw the
blank white walls speckled with pa
per ""spit-balls.""' lie was hot and
tired and dusty, and his toe hurt.
The truth was, that he had a.ked
his mother to permit him to stay
away from school, and klie refused to
allow him to do so. Mrs. Finn's at
tention had been pathetical'y drnvui
to the sore toe, and she hnd said that
tl;e injured member would not hurt
him any more at school than at
home. And so the boy looked cross
and felt tiffly towards the distasteful
Vddication,"" which hi mother forced
upon him. As he limped along the
dusty road, he looked oft over the
meadow and saw the maples and
pines in Lindaley's wood whispering
to each other, as they waved in the
breeie which blew fresh and cool
from the Hudson river. These whis
pers Mickey interpreted as coaxing
invitations, which sounded to him as
follows:
""Come, little Mike, and lie under our
protecting branches! Here you will
find the tender birch bark and the
juicy sassafras root! Lpon our
shady hillocks hidden by glossy
STeen leaves, hide the rrd winter
ureen berries awaiting your oominff!
The tree toad will sinp !' nP
for you, the bubbling spring is dis
tilling a spnrkiiiifr IWpior for your
thirsty lips, and the shady coverts of
our sylvan dells await yo-.i!""
With thee enchant intf voices in his
ear the temptation to play hookey
was a strong one. The tempter of
men came to hi in with the liquid
melody .of birds, the soft wooing- of
fluttering leaves, the rustle of the
dne'a thin flnfrers, and the purple of
brooks. And as he stood in the dusty
road and looked down into the hol
low at the sun beatinp fiercely upon
the windows of the little red school
house, and realized how stifllnp was
the air inside, what wonder that he
hesitated!
Then the reproachful face of his
mother row? before him. As little
Mike loved his mother and feared her
rebuke more than he did her heavy
hand, the thoupht of her grief im
pelled him onward toward the school.
Hut he could not shut out of his men
tal sight the picture of the cool par
adise in the wood where the little
lake rippled in the sunlight, and
where, far below, ran the wide reach
es of the Hudson river as it loitered
to the sea. And in this entrancing
picture his mother's face was blotted
out as with s sponge from the slate
of his mind; the schoolhouse was for
gotten and he limped eaperly toward
the stone wall to which clung the ri
otous wild ra.wpberry bushes laden
with fruit. Forgotten was the sore
toe, lost sipht of was the long, black
strap hanging n the kitchen wall,
and left behind was the dusty road
and all the suggestions of work
On arriving at the summit of the
hill little Mike turned in his tracks
and looked down upon the school
house. He saw the master come to
the door and ring the-bell, and his
schoolmates scamper like corralled
sheep into the building. Then the
door was shut and Mickey realized
that his sin was irrevocable. He
trembled, too, when he thought
that he wou!d have to make confes
sion to the priest. But it was too
late to retrace his steps. He was now
in the narrow path leading to the
woods. He took off his tattered cap
and the cool fingers of the breezes
lifted the hair from his forehead. As
be sat down on the grass a striped
chipmunk stopped, palpitsting. on
the stone wall, and little Mike s fin
gers itched for his bow-pun. After
hiding hi books in the stone wall
and covering them with dead leaves
be began picking and eating raspber
ries until hi bronzed cheeks were
covered with the jnices of the fruit.
The scent of clover blooms and fresh
grasses made his notrils dilate, and
while the birds sang for him from
the trees the nodding buttercups snd
daisies shook their heads at him and
seemed to say:
""Little boy, yon're playing hookey !""
When Mickey entered the woods
he lay down upon the brown needles
at the foot of the pine trees and
watched the butterflies flittirg over
him on yellow wrings. And as he lay
there the luxury of indolence stole in
upon his senses and the gentle sough
ing of the pines fell with a soothing
Influence upon hi ear. The drowsy
hum of bees and the inarticulate
voices of the wood lulled him to
6leep. How long he lay there Mickey
could not tell. He wa rudely awak
ened by a big black ant which had
crawled up hi trousers leg, and a
great yellow, hairy caterpillar cross
Vi g the bridge of his nose. A he sat
up and brushed away these insects a
cat-bird in a tree near by began to
jeer at him with what to Mickey' ex
cited fancy were the words:
Tlaying hookey! Playing hookey!""
In some mysterious manner gladness
Seemed to go out of the day for little
Mike at this cruel tannt. The odors of
the flower were just as sweet as they
had been before, the moss at the foot
of the pine trees was as vivid a preen,
the swallows dipped as gracefully over
the field of billowy wheat, but the
charm of all this beauteous panorama
w as gone. His toe began to hurt again.
With drooping head and limping gait,
Mickey plunged deeper into the woods.
At the foot of a big rock be found a
spring. Lying at full length upon the
sward he put his lips down to the Ma
ted and drank deep of the champagne
of the woods. The reflection of his face
in the spring grinned sardonically at
him. And from the brown eyes shin
ing from the cool depths came a re
proachful glance which seemed to say:
""The leather strap is w aiting for you
in the kitchen!""
All that afternoon he wandered
farough the woods seeking happiness,
but finding none. He flew for refuge
to the birch tree, but the bark hud
lost all its old-time sweetness. The
aassufras root which often bad tasled
like honey in his mouth now took on
the flavor of worm-wood. As he re
traced his steps to the stone wall
R here he had hidden his books the aw
ful consciousness came to him that he
would be obliged to tell a lie in order
to escape a whipping. Like a thief in
the nif.'ht he sneaked down the steep
hillside up which he had climbed so
cheerfully in the morning, and five
minutes later entered the shanty. So
i!on iicust w as he and so furtive in man
ner that his mother's attention was at
tracted to him. J ust at this moment a
big bumble bee wearing a black velvet
vest w ith yellow stripes blundered into
the room.
""Are ye sick, Mickey?"" said his
mother, solicitously.
""Xo; I'm not sick, mother,"" said lit
tle Mike, ""but me toe is hurtin' me.""
""Well, what makes ye act so
quare ?""
This was uttered in such a tone of
solicitude and with so kindly a look
that little Mike's eyes begun to over
flow as his mother tried to ""shoo"" the
bumble bee out of the room.
""I'm glad you're not a w icked little
boy, Mickey, like thim Doolans,"" con
tinued Mrs. Finn. ""If ye were I'd be
thinkin that bumble bes would be
afther stingin' ye. Shure that's what
bumble bees does be doin' stinpn' lit
tle boys fur their sins!""
Slap went the end of Mrs. Finn's
apron against the wall and away willed
the bee out of the w indow like an ani
mated jewel of jet and amber.
Little Mike wua oppressed with
fears. The haunting consciousness of
wrong-doing weighed him down like
the guilt of a murderer. He felt a
pre t load taken off his conscience
when the bumble bee flew out of the
window, for he believed implicitly that
the insect had flown into the shanty
for the purpose of stinging him be
cause he had played ""hookey."" He
busied himself about the yard, milking
the goat and chopping wood. He wus
so unusually zealous and quiet in this
work, that his mother's suspicions
were awakened.
""Faix,"" said she, ""I'm sfeerd me lit
tle boy's been up to mischief, he's actin'
that quare. Shure, he has berry
stains on his face, an there's no berries
ut school. Musha, I'm afther thinkin'
he was playin' hookey!""
Just then Mickey came into the
shanty with another armful of wood.
His mother looked at him closely, un
observed by the boy, and saw that his
knees were stained with grass juice
and that to the back of his jacket clung
some tell-tale pine needles. Hut she
kept her own counsel and awaited de
velopments, satisfied that Mickey
would confess his guilt. Another arm
ful of wood had been thrown nnder
the stove, and little Mike looked up to
catch the expected approving glance
of his mother, when Mrs. Finn cried Tn
alarm:
""Look out, Mickey; here comes the
bumble bee fur ye!""
Again the fears of the boy were
awakened, and turning quickly he
struck a frantic blow at the bee. This
evidently angered the insect, for it
avoided the blow, flew over the boy's
bead and stung him on the back of the
neck. Having punished the truant and
Mtisfied its vengeance the bumble bee
flew out of the door. As Mrs. Finp
bound a handful of mud upon the
swelling wound little Mike looked up
In his mother's face, and, with trem
bling voice full of remorse and pain,
said in a hoarse whisper:
""M-m-mother!""
""Yes, Mickey,"" said Mrs. Finn, know
ing that the time of confession had
come. The boy continued with quiver
ing lips:
""I know why the bee s-s-tung me.
litkase I bckase mother I I 1
was playin' piay playin' hookey!""
As he hid his face in his mother's
dress she stooped over him and her lips
vouched the bronzed, berry-stoined
,'aee in the fond kiss of forgiveness. At
her warm breath dried the brine upon
sis cheek the bumble bee buried itself
fur shame in a blue and white morning
glory which hung like an infant beJ
bver the doorway.

METEORITES GOOD AS GOLD.
Cbaaees to Get Rich When Shootlng
Slar Showers Come I poo
the Earth.
If any one is so lucky as to find one
of the shooting stars ic the meteoric
showers, he may congratulate himself
on having captured a prize worth its
weight in gold. The number of col
lectors of meteorites is increasing, and
the competition between the different
cabinets, public and private, has caused
a great advance in the price of rare
specimens.
The largjst and finest collection of
meteorites on this side of the Atlantic
is the one in the Harvard Mineralogies!
museum in Cambridge. Keckoning
European collections it ranks about
fifth or sixth in the world. The lirit
ish museum has the best collection, as
It has of so many other things, and the
cabinets in Vienna and Paris rank
next, says the Xew Y'ork Sun.
Calculating the comparative value of
collections of meteorites is something
of an art. A main point to be taken
into consideration is the number of
""falls,"" so called, which are represent
ed. Ordinarily, perhaps, each meteoric
mass which is found represents a sep
arate fall; but often a meteorite sp'.its
into several pieces, falling 50 or 100
miles distant from one another on
striking the earth's atmosphere. The
common origin of such pieces is often
demonstrated by analysis or by general
appearance, but more often, perhaps,
it remains in doubt.
About 275 fall are represented at
Harvard, with a total weight another
factor in estimating comparative value
of about 2,800 pounds. The largest
meteorite know n is the famous one dis
covered by Peary in Greenland. The
largest mieteorite in the Cambridge
collection weighs 1.1C0 pounds. Hut
the largest meteorite is not necessarily
the most valuable. Much depends on
the matter of ""control."" A very large
and famous meteorite is Canon Diablo,
so called in accordance with the recog
nized rule for naming meteorites, from
the locality in Arizona where it was
found. Here grest pieces of a thousand
pounds or more can be obtained by any
one who wants them for the troubl.'
snd expense of carting them away. In
other words, no one controls it, and it
bas little or no money value. On the
other hand, a much smaller and less
Interesting meteorite owned wholly
or mainly by a single cabinet is likely to
be worth hundreds of dollars. A single
small piece of some notable meteorite
thus held may easily be valued, for ex
ample, at the rate of $75 or $100 a pound.
The pound, indeed, is much too clumsy
a standard for so valuable a material
as meteorite stone or iron, and the
weight of all specimens is recorded ii
the catalogues in grammes.
In ancient times and among savage
tribes meteorites have always been
looked upon with more or lest awe,
and! have often been objects of worship.
The Palladium which fell at Troy, for
example, was doubtless a meteorite
In three small meteorites discovered
by the Peabody museum on altars
raised by the mound builders of the
Little Miami valley in Ohio, Harvard
possesses the only authentic prehis
toric exsmples known to exist. Such
srchaeological or historical interest
naturally adds much to the market
value of a meteorite. A well-known
American collector recently secured
from the shah of Persia a number of
pieces from a famous semi-sacred
meteorite which had been in the pos
session of the royal family for genera.
Hons, and by disposing of bits to va
rious European museums on his way
home, was sble, he said, to pay all the
expenses of his trip to Teheran.
The earliest American fall recorded
is Campodel Cielo. from the Argentine
republic, 17S3; and the first in the
United States is the Weston, Connecti
cut, 1807.

Hospitals in our great cities are sad places to visit.
Three-fourths of the patients lying on those snow-white
beds are women and girls.
Why should this be the case ?
Because they have neglected themselves.
Every one of these patients in the hospital beds had plenty
of warning in that bearing-down feeling, pain at the left or
right of the womb, nervous exhaustion, pain in the small of
the back. All of these things are indications of an unhealthy
condition of the ovaries or womb.
What a terrifying thought ! these poor souls are lying
there on those hospital beds awaiting a fearful operation.
Do not drag along at home or in your place of employ
ment until you are obliged to go to the hospital and submit to
an examination and possible operation. Build up the female
system, cure the derangements which have signified them
selves by danger signals, and remember that Lvdia 13.
